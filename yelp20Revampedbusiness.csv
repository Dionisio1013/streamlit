Red bean-filled buns, mung bean-filled buns, coconut stuff, egg tarts etc.  If you buy a dozen, they will give you two more for free.  The prices are standard for a Chinese bakery, with most things at approximately $1.  The service has always been good.  They do serve coffee and tea.

4,4.0,"HK-STYLE MILK TEA:  FOUR STARS

Not quite sure why there are two Saint Honore Pastries business listings on Yelp, but I have been checking in to this one.

Boyfriend and I go by it all the time while in Chinatown, but it never crossed our mind to try it.  I think we might have tried it once a year or two ago, but it wasn't memorable.  I decided to try the HK-style milk tea not too long ago and was hooked.  I think I went here almost every day one week to get the milk tea, only to realize that I should REALLY watch my sugar intake...it's sooo good!  

I personally don't think it's better than Zhong Gang's HK-style milk tea because they have their off days when a certain lady makes them (not enough ice, too much ice, etc.).

On a side note:  I wanted to try the crispy roast pork bun, but accidentally said the wrong name in Chinese and got the roast pork bun.  It was decent enough, although I will get to trying the crispy roast pork bun soon!  

I will be back~",MTSW4McQd7CbVtyjqoe9mw,St Honore Pastries,Philadelphia,4.0,-75.1555641,39.9555052,"Restaurants, Food, Bubble Tea, Coffee & Tea, Bakeries","{'Monday': '7:0-20:0', 'Tuesday': '7:0-20:0', 'Wednesday': '7:0-20:0', 'Thursday': '7:0-20:0', 'Friday': '7:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '7:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '7:0-21:0'}",935 Race St,PA

7,4.0,"Impression: The good thing is that there are like 5-6 of these kinds of Asian Chinese bakeries around Chinatown- Mong Kok is another one that sells the same get up: sesame balls, roll cakes, taro buns, egg tarts, meat buns, ham and cheese breads- your typical Hong Kong South East Asian kinds of bakeries that sell their fares for less than 1$ each. The bad thing is, b/c it is the same as the rest, it may be hard to find something you've never tried before- but their cheese cakes looked to be their stand apart from other bakeries. This is the only ""Asian"" bakery on this street across from Nine Ting, the new Taiwanese popcorn chicken, right by Red King BBQ, and Wong Wong Restaurant. It's a solid Chinese bakery- neither fancy nor cheap and poor quality, neither special or bland but solid if you're looking for the typical Chinese desserts and pastries 

Because it's cheap, feel free to load up on a large stash of goodies! Egg tarts were 0.80$, sesame balls were also 0.80$ and the green tea roll cake was only 3.50$. I like to take these treats home and eat them slowly over the next few days. The sesame balls and the tarts taste great if you stick them in the microwave and zap it for 30 seconds to 1 min.

I was wondering what was wrong with the cake at first for that price, but it was surprisingly as delicious as it looked.  Everything in here just looks appetizing.  I like Asian bakeries because the cakes are not overly sweet as most ones are in American Bakeries.  

      I have tried the chocolate cake, and different versions of the vanilla cake here (bunny and cherry).  Both were fluffy, moist, simple, and slightly sweet.  They didn't really have any difference in taste though.  The main difference here seems to be the cute decoration.  I'm okay with that though.  I get excited like a five year old child at the idea of what cute animal or fruit I will get on my cake next.  The mango pudding was okay, but not as good as I've had in some Thai restaurants, or even what I could make at home.  I haven't tried any of the buns, but they do look tasty and are priced right.  They also offer bubble tea and smoothies here, but I haven't tried them.  I'm always too distracted by the cake.

25,4.0,"Really good egg tarts. Scratch that, probably the best egg tarts in Philly. I keep trying to catch them straight out of the oven, but I think you probably have to ask them for that or something, because the last time I watched them bring out a fresh batch of egg tarts, and ordered it, it was still cold. Definitely still, good, I just want to try them right when they come out of the oven. I wish I knew when they baked those darn egg tarts. I'll have to ask them next time. Anyways, unlike most of the places in Chinatown, they use a flaky crust for their egg tarts. Pair that with the sweet, creamy baked egg custard filling, and it is a match made in heaven haha. Flaky crusts are the way to go for egg tarts. 

Their other buns and savory pastries are standard; taste the same to me anywhere I get them. My sister favors their butter bread though, which is very good, and can act as dinner rolls. The drinks here are ok, nothing special. They serve the standard milk tea, lemon tea, and they also have bubble tea, but I've never gotten that here. They have a few small tables for you to sit on, and a refrigerator with soda and canned/boxed drinks right by the door so you can grab and go(no five finger discount!!! Remember to pay). I've also had the lemon cake before, which wasn't bad, but sometimes I do stray from the cakes, as they don't always look fresh.

I don't think I've ever seen young people working here; it's usually 1 or 2 middle aged ladies behind the counter. They're not mean, but they're not overly friendly either. They just do their job, that's all it is. No extra smiles or small chat.

54,1.0,"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE service. I have never felt so disrespected by any establishment EVER. I walked in around 7:30pm on a Friday to pick up a birthday cake pre-ordered. I was waiting for a friend so I decided to buy an egg tart (somehow they charged me 90c even though the sign CLEARLY said 80c, but I wasn't in the mood to argue over 10c) and use the rest room while I waited. The door to the bathroom was locked and all I got as an explanation was, ""the last person to use it must have locked it behind them. We have no key."" HOW do you not have the key to your own bathroom? I was confused at first and thought it must be a simple misunderstanding but nope, they really just didn't want me to use their restroom. I asked them where they used the restroom if its locked and they just mumbled and didn't answer me (mind you, there was no language barrier--they completely understood me). So I sat down with the egg tart (which honestly wasn't even as good as those at other bakeries) and waited for my friend.

When I checked on the cake, the name was spelled wrong even though we had confirmed the spelling multiple times. So when I asked the woman to change it, she just had the biggest attitude. I could hear both women behind the counter talking about me, I guess they didn't realize that I could understand. Believe me, I am the first to admit if I am in the wrong or if I had any part in bad service received but this is the first time I have genuinely been shocked at how I was treated. I will never be back here again. Get your pastries somewhere else, where the employees are friendlier, where they won't unreasonably overcharge, and the food tastier.",MTSW4McQd7CbVtyjqoe9mw,St Honore Pastries,Philadelphia,4.0,-75.1555641,39.9555052,"Restaurants, Food, Bubble Tea, Coffee & Tea, Bakeries","{'Monday': '7:0-20:0', 'Tuesday': '7:0-20:0', 'Wednesday': '7:0-20:0', 'Thursday': '7:0-20:0', 'Friday': '7:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '7:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '7:0-21:0'}",935 Race St,PA

56,4.0,"Really good egg tarts. Scratch that, probably the best egg tarts in Philly. I keep trying to catch them straight out of the oven, but I think you probably have to ask them for that or something, because the last time I watched them bring out a fresh batch of egg tarts, and ordered it, it was still cold. Definitely still, good, I just want to try them right when they come out of the oven. I wish I knew when they baked those darn egg tarts. I'll have to ask them next time. Anyways, unlike most of the places in Chinatown, they use a flaky crust for their egg tarts. Pair that with the sweet, creamy baked egg custard filling, and it is a match made in heaven haha. Flaky crusts are the way to go for egg tarts. 

Their other buns and savory pastries are standard; taste the same to me anywhere I get them. My sister favors their butter bread though, which is very good, and can act as dinner rolls. The drinks here are ok, nothing special. They serve the standard milk tea, lemon tea, and they also have bubble tea, but I've never gotten that here. They have a few small tables for you to sit on, and a refrigerator with soda and canned/boxed drinks right by the door so you can grab and go(no five finger discount!!! Remember to pay). I've also had the lemon cake before, which wasn't bad, but sometimes I do stray from the cakes, as they don't always look fresh.

I don't think I've ever seen young people working here; it's usually 1 or 2 middle aged ladies behind the counter. They're not mean, but they're not overly friendly either. They just do their job, that's all it is. No extra smiles or small chat. And usually, there will be one or two middle aged/old men sitting toward the back reading the newspaper, making it seem more like the cafes in HK, where old people will hang out in cafes just to drink a cup of tea and pass the hours by. 

All in all, stop by here for an egg tarts, if nothing else.

58,5.0,"After coming from New York I knew I'd have to go through trial and error to find my go-to Chinese bakery in Philly.  After trying nearly all of the bakeries around Chinatown, this is probably my favorite.  First of all, the staff is very nice and helpful.  I wish I knew their names because I'd like to give proper credit to the staff, but the lady who speaks English without an accent is so friendly.  Every time I stop in she'll say hi and ask how I'm doing with a big smile.  I really feel like I'm a regular at this point.  I once came with my mom and now she's always asking how my mom is and when's the next time she'll be back.  

On to the buns.  I've tried most of the items available at the bakery.  There's a wide assortment of sweet and savory buns, desserts, and prepackaged steamed buns ready to go.  I'm really obsessed with Chinese style dried shredded pork, so I always have to get either the 'pork over bun' or the rolled up bun with green onion and dried pork any time I walk by.  To someone without much Chinese bakery experience this may sound weird but you have to give it a try, such a great balance of sweet, salty, savory, decadence.  Everything else for sale is also top notch.  I was lucky enough once to grab some egg tarts that were literally straight from the oven and I have to say at that point they were the best I've ever had in my life.  

They also have an assortment of hot and cold drinks available, but I don't have much experience with those.  All in all this is a must-go if you are wandering around Chinatown.  Stop in for a bun or a dessert.

The bread is so soft and tasty. It has the light taste of pork and scallion. I honestly expected a little more scallion to be in it, but it still tasted delicious. For those not familiar with this kind of roll, forewarning to those who don't like mayonnaise: it has a mayonnaise-like spread inside. I personally think it enhances the roll.

I also tried their roast pork bun for the first time. Do not miss out on this if you like roast pork !! This is a great combination of sweet and salty. The bun itself has the sweet topping and it's filled with the roast pork inside. I regret not buying more than one, especially because it's so affordable. :(

Service 4.5/5
The counter lady was all business but the two people in front of me were elderly and I thought she could have been a little gentler with their cake box. I'd a feeling there was an actual cake inside and the man commented to me that ""this is a peaceful place,"" right before she slammed his cake box on the counter. Now he epitomized customer loyalty but I could see (though he didn't say it) he didn't feel appreciated by the counter lady. A loyal customer is special and should be treated accordingly. 

Ambiance 3/5
I've been here before it's not peaceful. But I enjoyed the people watching. There are usually senior citizens sitting together watching the news in Chinese with a cup of coffee or tea it's lovely to see them. And even better b/c the scent of coffee wafting through the cafe/bakery smelled divine. I didn't order it though b/c I'm a habitual insomniac so no caffeine for me after 2pm.

Food
Egg tart 3/5
Though it was delicious it was way too sweet for me and i love sweets. The tart crust was perfect but the egg custard was too sweet. I won't order it again although it was very creamy and otherwise cooked perfectly.

Rainbow cake 5/5
Not too sweet - it was perfect and just the right amount of frosting. The sponge cake was moist and had the right texture. I basically have the pallet of a little kid so if i see rainbow sprinkles i say yes please.

My check came to $2 so I highly recommend you make a visit and try different items b/c at those prices you can afford to take some risks !",MTSW4McQd7CbVtyjqoe9mw,St Honore Pastries,Philadelphia,4.0,-75.1555641,39.9555052,"Restaurants, Food, Bubble Tea, Coffee & Tea, Bakeries","{'Monday': '7:0-20:0', 'Tuesday': '7:0-20:0', 'Wednesday': '7:0-20:0', 'Thursday': '7:0-20:0', 'Friday': '7:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '7:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '7:0-21:0'}",935 Race St,PA

Between the three of us, we ordered three drinks.  Two were beers, which is hard to mess up.  The last was supposed to have been a cherry vodka with sprite.  We instead got regular vodka with sometime resembling sprite (with about as much carbonation as a glass of water) and grenadine.  Needless to say, it didn't taste great.  I then ordered the saganaki.  The less than enthusiastic male who brought it out seemed to have added too much oil or something.  It proceeded to continue sizzling and shooting oil all over our table after he put it down.  The bottom was charred and stuck to the pan before it was even cool enough for us to take a bite.

110,4.0,"We took a group of nine, including a 3 year old and two babies, last night for dinner.  We had a really good time, the food was tasty and the staff was professional.  I have read the other reviews and have to wonder if they went to a different restaurant.  Maybe there have been some changes made, I am not sure.

I had the grouper special, it was really good and came with a topping of steamed spinach.  The Greek salad was fresh and well dressed.  We also had the saganaki appetizer, it was nice and large and tasty.  The pita was hot and crispy.  My mom ordered the greek sampler appetizer and it was really good.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, even my picky toddler.  She had chicken fingers and they were not greasy or over breaded.

We did not experience any of the staff drama discussed in earlier posts, nor did we find the place full of hoosiers.  Then again, maybe I am a hoosier in denial.... lol.  It had a good mix of older patrons and a few young couples.  The bar is separated by a wall, and there were some groups in there having drinks.  Overall, a  pretty normal crowd for a Monday.  It is not an upscale restaurant, nor do they pretend to be upscale.  It is a comfortable neighborhood eatery.  They are putting in a patio area that looks like it will be nice once it warms up again.

We will definitely be back.  Our food was hot, tasty and prompt.  Our drinks were refilled often and when we asked for more pita, it came out fast and hot.  Only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I have only been there the one time, so it is hard to claim perfection.",k0hlBqXX-Bt0vf1op7Jr1w,Tsevi's Pub And Grill,Affton,3.0,-90.3210868,38.5651648,"Pubs, Restaurants, Italian, Bars, American (Traditional), Nightlife, Greek",,8025 Mackenzie Rd,MO

Italian sub sandwich is one of the best I have had, and I have had many!  Meatballs are from a good basic recipe but add the sauce and Mama Mia!  Parm sandwiches are super tasty as well.  All of the food is enough to share, but don't.  You'll regret it.
Also has some deli items and salads available.  Lots of imported olives and those wonderful Italian cookies for dessert, or antipasta in our case!  Some dry goods available, olive oils, imported canned goods.
The counter service makes our visit complete.  Employees are busy but focused and super accomodating.  Owner works his ars off like everyone else which I find a plus.  They even bake their own bread!  So good!

220,1.0,"Note:  the food section of this review is for the sausage & peppers sub, as I've tried nothing else.  

Cesarina Deli is a simple but nice dining location on East Bay.   While it looked like most coming in and out were there for the deli sandwich choices, they've got a few shelves of the most popular Italian grocery items.   In the deli prepared food section they carry cured meats, cheeses, olives, about half a dozen pasta choices & and some more cold salad dishes.  They also have several cases with bakery items, bread & cookies.

If you want to dine in there are tables to the left that seat ~20 or so.  But I was here to taste test one of my favorite subs, the sausage & peppers.

My order at the counter was taken fairly quickly even though there were about 5 people in line.  It was well-wrapped in foil to keep it take-out hot and I appreciated that.  And the size of the wrapped sub quickly showed that Cesarina definitely delivers an extremely large sub for the price.

But while it was still hot when I arrived home, when I opened up the foil wrap I found the sorriest looking sausage & peppers sub I've ever seen in my life.  The green peppers and onions were cooked to death in heavy oil to the point they had virtually no flavor.  The oil almost completely soaked the sub roll, and the dry portion of the roll I did manage to taste was not that flavorful and a bit tough to chew.  To top off this sad collection was the sausage link.  While I'm a huge fan of meat in tube form, and I've had many sausages in different ethnic cuisines, most all Italian sausages I've ever found have been a nice mix of  full meat flavor and spice.  But this link was the most bland taste with only spicey hot flavors.  Worse yet, the inside of the link was just ...well, just a disgusting grey color.  I'm not foolish enough to think sausages are made of any prime pork cuts, but hey, if you're going to leave out the flavor at least throw me a bone with some red dye #3 like a hot dog so it resembles something that might be meat related.   Sure, it's a carcinogen, but I'd trade that even up if at least fooled the cro-magnon portion of my meat-eating brain into thinking I was dining on something edible.

Combining the tasteless grey sausage link with likewise sad, soggy sausage and peppers, after two bites I found the entire sub completely inedible and tossed it in the trash.  And I can't think of hardly any food I've ordered in a decade or two that turned my stomach as bad as this sub.

Again, this food review is for one sandwich and nothing else.  And while this experience would normally make me write off Cesarina completely, the other reviews of the cold subs or prepared foods would not stop me from stopping by again and trying one of them.  If I do, I'll update my review and scores accordingly.

227,5.0,"Had a graduation party catered by Zio's recently, and it is the real Italian deal, folks. Delicious red sauces cooked in house, amazing meatballs, and antipasto trays to die for that included some of the best mortadela I've ever tasted. Don't even get me started on their fresh-baked Italian bread. If you're from up north, then you know real Italian bread is hard to find down here, but not anymore!

I went to the actual store today for lunch and was torn between the ""30 napkin"" meatball sub, and the Italian.  I saw someone else order the meatball, and it was offensively MASSIVE.  I imagine a fork and knife is required because unless you're a retired porn actress, your mouth probably doesn't open that wide.  The freaking meatballs are the size of tennis balls.  No joke.

I was wearing a shirt I really like, so I went the less-saucy route and ordered an Italian sub.  As soon as the woman behind the counter grabbed the bread, I knew I wasn't gonna be able to take it down, so I immediately asked them for half to go.  The bread is probably 13 or 14 inches, but it's the girth that stands out.  This ain't no Publix or Subway bread.  This sandwich was big, thick and meaty.  And just to spice it up a bit, I added Capocollo to it.  What I ended up with was the best Italian sub I've had in Florida.  A full 5 out of 5 on my Italian sub scale.

Lastly, it should be noted that this place is a market and deli store that sells a lot of imported grocery items.  There are a few tables for those who wish to dine in, but while I was there, most people called ahead and got their orders to go.

Be sure to try their Italian sub (I like mine with mayo added), their meatball sub, and their mufalatta.  Oh and notice you can get halfs of all of these so be sure you and your friends get different ones to try!

A tiny little poorly appointed dining area, and tons of case line, with pre-prepared foods, deli type foods and baked goods. A big counter for sandwich/sub making... and while there, that's all I saw them sell, I think maybe their main attraction is fresh baked breads for the their subs. 

Several of us ate their Lasagna (with meat sauce... seriously, just meat over top?!?)... not that flavorful or good.  Also an alfredo sauced cheese tortellini with chicken... had a strange spice and was watery... not good. Salad ""dressing"" was the best item we had. 

Bakery area... cookies ""looked"" good... sadly they seemed old, flavorless and had an aftertaste that made us realize they absorbed and picked up the odors of the business itself... YUK!!! 

Overall... I'll NEVER return and do not recommend... sorry.",0bPLkL0QhhPO5kt1_EXmNQ,Zio's Italian Market,Largo,4.5,-82.7604608,27.9161159,"Food, Delis, Italian, Bakeries, Restaurants","{'Monday': '10:0-18:0', 'Tuesday': '10:0-20:0', 'Wednesday': '10:0-20:0', 'Thursday': '10:0-20:0', 'Friday': '10:0-20:0', 'Saturday': '10:0-20:0'}",2575 E Bay Dr,FL

I ordered a calzone with sausage. They asked spicy or regular, I ordered for spicy. They called back and stated they don't have Italian sausage. So I ordered it with pepperoni. My co-worker got a side of Italian sausage. Turns out they misinformed me when they called, since they had regular sausage, just not the spicy. I can forgive some incompetence like this. However, when my calzone arrived it did not have any ricotta in it at all. I called to inform of them of their mistake. The lady became rude stating that the pepperoni calzones are pre-made and do NOT come with ricotta. I stated the online menu says that they come with ricotta, and the lady informed me they do not. I was told they are pre-made. I stated they should have told me on either of our prior two phone conversations that the calzone would not have ricotta because I added pepperoni to it. The lady gave me even more attitude. That makes two lies on their menu. The calzones are not ""folded and baked to order"" and do are not ""stuffed with Ricotta"". I will never order from here again.

Well the weather was not being kind so we just went straight there and I asked my cousin to come with me to the store so we could get something everybody would like and spend some quality time together. We headed up to Publix to get something from the deli but when I saw that their deli no longer makes it fresh, he made a call to his mom and she recommended Cesarina. 

When we arrived, there was a line but OMG did this place smell good. I looked around while my cousin waited in line. The cases were loaded up with some sides, meats, sausages, desserts and olives. I thought I died and went to heaven. I even found some dried pasta that was hand made that I have not been able to find locally. 

I bought some of the potato salad, tortellini salad, two varieties of olives and some marinated artichoke hearts along with 2 bags of pasta to take home to Orlando with me. The ribs my cousin made were lip smackin good but those sides and olives were ALL incredible. The next time I am in Largo, you can bet I will be stopping by this place to grab a few things to take back home to Orlando.

Also try their pasta salads, they are excellent, my favorite is the macaroni salad.  As mentioned in earlier posts, the value in this place is almost unheard of.

On such a short notice, like 30 minutes before they closed. they put together two large trays of the cookies, plus another huge tray of their wonderful lasagna.

274,5.0,"Tuna Bar is a new sushi digs in Old City, a relatively upscale neighborhood in a city flooded with mediocre sushi restaurants. I frequent laban's favorites, bubblefish being one of them and the last visit left something to be desired. The fork in the road left me with two options, Royal Izakaya or Tuna Bar, and boy am I glad I chose the latter.

The ambiance is on point, and the service is friendly and welcoming. The menu is curated beautifully, from my understanding they narrowed it down quite a bit from the other location. This means everything on the menu is guaranteed to be fantastic and FRESH.

We started with the steamed chicken dumplings which were light and steamed to perfection. The ginger salad followed with slices of avocado and wonderfully balanced ginger dressing that wasn't too sweet. And they even do spring mix, which was great considering romaine isn't the best these days. 

For our sushi selections we went with the classic dragon roll, the east roll, the j & j roll, and 4 pieces of the tasmanian salmon, which is a fattier cut of wild caught alaskan salmon. The fish absolutely melted in your mouth and highlighted the night beautifully. The dragon roll was crafted wonderfully and the rice on every selection seemed to highlight the delicate subtleties of genuinely fresh fish. The wasabi was even a notch above. I don't know what else I can say besides try it for yourself. The preparation of everything was so wonderfully thought out and you can tell they care about what they do here. Ken was also present and very humble about my compliments.

At 7:30pm, It was very crowed, fortunately we made a reservation. We were seated quickly by the window. The server was friendly and nice. Each of use ordered a drink. I ordered Lychee - it's a $15 cocktail. The drink was plain and I could barely taste alcohol. For the price I pay, I would expect a fantastic cocktail. Who wouldn't? 

Then it comes to the sushi. We actually also ordered a fried rice. It's very average fried rice, like the ones you can get in Chinatown for $8. But you pay double of the price in this ""fancy"" restaurant. The sushi was ok. Just ok. I'm a sushi lover, and I've tried many sushi restaurants, good and bad. The sushi we had was just average.

Ordered three rolls and they were awful.  The spicy tuna and the unagi rolls contained this weird mixture, which I assume was pureed fish.  I've never experienced that before.  The salmon rolls had too much rice and the seaweed was too thick.  We slathered the rolls in soy sauce and wasabi to make them more palatable. 

Ordered three pieces of sushi.  They were some of the largest pieces of sushi I've ever had. The salmon was not fresh.  The hamachi was boring.  The striped bass, which was the cheapest of the sushis, was actually the most flavorful. 

A crisp Riesling is usually a good accompaniment to sushi.  Unfortunately, there is not one on the menu.  The one they had was cloyingly sweet, with no acid or fruit.  It wasn't even finished!  The pinot noir was too earthy.  The cava, while not great, was the best of the options.

Very clean decor, I am glad they didn't put up any kind of cheap or fake Asian ""artworks"" on the wall.

We ordered an appetizer and side dish to go with our sushi rolls. We chose Creamy Rock Shrimp, Lobster Fried Rice, Sindy Roll and Old City Roll. All in all, they were all very tasty, high quality and we enjoyed them very much. Yes, everything was perfect until we ordered some desserts... 

Since they didn't have a dessert menu, we ordered Tree Cake and Green Tea Cheesecake based on the description of the dessert that our waitress gave us. 

This so-called Tree Cake...I call it ""rip-off"" cake. Our waitress described it as a cake made with almond, egg and butter. When it came out, I was shocked what it really was... If you are familiar with a common and popular sweets in Japan, one of them is called Baumkuchen which is actually a German layered cake. They can be purchased from most bakeries and stores, and not so pricey unless you go to some fancy boutique to get it. The cake we were presented with, in my opinion, was store-bought, and sliced as thinly as possible. For $10, you can buy an entire cake!!! Very disappointing... And on top of that, it was dry (with these thin slices being cut off from the cake, I wonder how long it has been since the cake was first purchased?). And if that is not enough, we were given spoons to eat this...why? I don't know...

Our waitress was very friendly and polite, and we were well taken care of. Everything we had, other than the Tree Cake was great. High quality and tasty, a bit on pricey side, but that comes with the quality. I wish if we made a different choice with the dessert. But then, you live and you learn.

313,4.0,"This was a great dinner out with some outstanding dishes. A couple of things that did not wow me as noted below but overall I thought this place was top notch. Atmosphere was lovely and our service was mostly excellent.

Wok Kampachi Ceviche app: Delicious! Sweet, savory, umami yumminess.
Tuna tartare app: This was the only dish that I would not order again. The tuna was super fresh but it came too cold and bland. If you are hoping for something akin to the tuna tartare at Morimoto's, this is not it.
Lychee martini- The first one I had was very sweet without enough tang. The second one was better. I would order again. I would suggest that the bar get some fresh lychee to garnish the drink in the future. My first came with flower petals, my second came with a dried orange slice.

Rolls:
Sindy: Excellent! Favorite roll of the night. I had never had a roll without rice before and I'm a convert. Everything was fresh and presented just right. No weird temperature issues with the crispy eel. I'm coming back to this place because of this roll.
Dynamite White Tuna - Best spicy tuna I've had.
Dragon roll - this is a standard sushi offering. Getting it here will make you happy. Quality ingredients, perfect combo.
Peppered tuna - the most understated of the rolls we had. Kind of like a tuna salad flavor. I liked the daikon. You might want to start instead of end with this roll. It did not wow me after the others I had with the bold flavors.

Small issue- No soy sauce on our table so we had to grab one from a neighboring table.

318,4.0,"Great interior design for 1-on-1 dates or for bigger parties. Its basically a sushi restaurant, but kind of a fusion too because of the other types of food they serve. They also have a bar and I would recommend their cocktails (Geisha). As a party of 3 and we basically ordered 3 appetizers and 3 rolls, and it was definitely filling. The rolls came on one tray for us so we ate it family-styled. However, I saw tables where people had their own plates of sushi as well. 

I thought the brussel sprouts were really good, it had an asian style to it, probably from the sesame oil/seeds. The tuna tatare was served over a crispy thin cracker, which balanced out the creamy avocado and tuna. The mai fried rice was decent, just fried rice.

For rolls, we ordered the peppered tuna, white tuna, and J&J. Though the specialty roll (J&J) was almost double the price of the regular roll, there was definitely more going on and it was a lot more filling. I'd recommend getting at least one specialty roll.

The place wasn't very crowded and there seemed to be an abundance of servers, but we sat waiting at the table for about 15 minutes before the waitress even came to fill our water. We ordered right away and the food came out relatively quickly, but nothing really wowed me. We started with the fried brussel sprouts which were tasty but not as good as ones I've had elsewhere (I'm looking at you, Sampan). I had miso soup which was fine but served in a large bowl and filled not even a quarter of the way. Definitely not worth the $6. We shared the lobster fried rice which was okay- not an abundance of lobster and a consistency that made it very difficult to eat with chopsticks. Finally we got 3 sushi rolls (2 house rolls and a special roll). They were tasty but not spectacular and had a tendency to fall apart easily. I did appreciate the presentation of the rolls served on a large wooden platter. All together our bill was $70 (no drinks) which was definitely not worth it for what we received.

From either end of the table you got views from the restaurant and from the outside which I thought was magnificent. 

The restaurant per say is beautiful, it has very chic. modern and elegant decor. They have leather booths and small tables and a nice design throughout the restaurant. The music is audible but not extremely loud that disrupts your conversation. 

The service was also very good and our waitress was very pleasant. 

As for the meal everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. We tried the shishito peppers which were perfectly seasoned and the fried Brussels sprouts which were also perfectly crunchy. For our main course we ordered both the Fishtown and Old City sushis and they were SO SO GOOD I'm still dreaming about them. The desserts were also good but not mind blowing (this was the only ok part of our meal). We tried both the Green Tea and the Tree Cake and they were traditional Japanese Sponge Cake which was very good but not exactly what we were expecting as our dessert. 

Our glasses of wine and proseco were also very good - I just wish they offered half bottles at a more convenient price. 

Bottom line is, If you are in old city and looking for a place to dine don't think about it twice.",MUTTqe8uqyMdBl186RmNeA,Tuna Bar,Philadelphia,4.0,-75.1432262,39.953949,"Sushi Bars, Restaurants, Japanese","{'Tuesday': '13:30-22:0', 'Wednesday': '13:30-22:0', 'Thursday': '13:30-22:0', 'Friday': '13:30-23:0', 'Saturday': '13:30-23:0', 'Sunday': '13:30-22:0'}",205 Race St,PA

We had the tuna tartare & wagyu egg rolls to start. The tuna tartare was delicious- very refreshing & the flavors were amazing. The egg rolls were good- nothing too out of this world but still very tasty. 

We also ordered the Fishtown roll, salmon/avocado rolls & the peppered tuna roll. The Fishtown roll is just the right amount of spice to it. The avocado in the roll was creamy and delicious. I wasn't a fan of the peppered tuna roll but my boyfriend really liked it. 

A few rounds & a few rolls will cost you a few dollars, but definitely worth it for a night out with loved ones.

I had the chance to try Tuna Bar for the first time with my husband and my cousin. We were all really impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant (even if we did get blasted with cold air every time someone new entered).

We started with the pork gyoza and fried oysters. When we asked our server how many oysters came in an order, she said 2 per order. We ordered two so that all of us could try an oyster. When the plates came out, there were three gigantic oysters on each of them. So, we really didn't need to order 2 at all. The oysters were OK, nothing special. They mostly tasted like breading. The gyoza were disappointing. They really didn't have much flavor and tasted basically like plain ol' pork sausage.

The actual sushi itself was really good, though. I got some salmon sushi, a yellowtail and chive roll with scallion oil, and a spicy tuna roll. I loved the sushi - it was so tender and melted in your mouth. I also can't say enough good things about the yellowtail/chive/scallion roll. It was...really unique and delicious. I would definitely order that again and advise that you try it for yourself!

Overall, I enjoyed my meal here. I thought their cocktail list left a lot to be desired and that the price for everything was too steep for what you actually got. While I won't be making any grand effort to return, I wasn't dissatisfied with my meal here.",MUTTqe8uqyMdBl186RmNeA,Tuna Bar,Philadelphia,4.0,-75.1432262,39.953949,"Sushi Bars, Restaurants, Japanese","{'Tuesday': '13:30-22:0', 'Wednesday': '13:30-22:0', 'Thursday': '13:30-22:0', 'Friday': '13:30-23:0', 'Saturday': '13:30-23:0', 'Sunday': '13:30-22:0'}",205 Race St,PA
346,4.0,"4.0 - 4.5 star Review. I compare all sushi restaurants to Philadelphia's best - Royal Sushi at 5 stars. Tuna Bar may be the cities second best option in terms of the variety of fish offered and quality.

Nice modern restaurant in Old City located on the main floor of a condo building. Service was excellent on both my visits. You can take your time and enjoy the meal, have a drink or two. Nice laid back atmosphere.

A few appetizers stood out for me - Wagyu beef spring roles, Seaweed salad, Sashimi salad and I loved the Grandmom's wonton soup.  

The Tuna Bar is at its best serving fresh sushi / sashimi.  I was with larger groups so got to try many of the house rolls which were mostly good but I was happiest ordering from the Sushi A La-Carte section of the menu. The fish was incredibly fresh and not the same boring pieces (i.e. Salman, Tuna, Ebi etc....) served at the 100+ sushi restaurants in Philadelphia.   

Loved the variety of fatty tuna options (Toro and Otoro but no Chutoro when I was there - different options available depending on the day), 1-2 Uni choices, Maguro, Kampachi, Striped Bass, Hamachi and Unagi.  

If you want above average sushi options / quality, give the Tuna Bar a try. Prices are above average but to be expected given the variety and quality.

Now on to the food. All in all we ordered Grandmom's wonton soup, the Soba Noodles, and the Wentz, Sindy, Rittenhouse, Dragon, and Spicy Scallop Rolls. Everything was delicious! Now we're no Japanese cuisine experts but my boyfriend said that was the best wonton soup he's ever had. The soba noodles were very flavorful and tender and all of the rolls were to die for. Every roll was unique and delicious but we agreed our favorite was the Sindy roll. Instead of it being wrapped in soy paper or seaweed it's wrapped in thinly shaved tuna. Something we had never seen before. 

My boyfriend had only casually mentioned it was my birthday in front of the host but the host was keen enough to pick up on that so the chef made us a small raw fish appetizer that was to die for and since we hadn't saved room for dessert our server, Dori, brought us over two small dessert drinks before we left. Very thoughtful and sweet on everyone's part!

352,3.0,"I really wanted to like Tuna Bar and was looking forward to our Valentine's Day dinner reservation. After making the reservation and realizing we weren't able to preview the prix fixe menu, I decided to contact the restaurant since my boyfriend has a shellfish allergy and this can often be a problem with sushi. I called, no answer. So I messaged them via Facebook. I explained his allergy and asked if this would be issue with the menu and their exact response was ""...confirmed with management and there will be no shellfish on tonight's menu..."" (See pic) 

Great, so we went. As soon as we sat down and looked at the menu we realized almost half of it included shrimp aka SHELLFISH (see V-day menu pic). Now maybe they were unaware that shrimp is shellfish? Or maybe they were just too lazy to actually check when I inquired, but either way, it's pretty inexcusable to ignore someone's food allergies and risk a health scare. What if we had asked if a dish included shellfish and my boyfriend had eaten it due to their ignorance? We would have ended up at the hospital. 

I'm giving three stars because our waiter did his best to accommodate us once we were already seated and expecting a decent meal. The sushi roll  that he subbed for the 6th course (didn't have a name, his creation) was pretty quality and we did really enjoy it.

The waiter was very patient and thorough with making sure my friend did not encounter any wheat products.

However, this was the turning point in our dining experience. We ordered the Fried Oysters, J&J Roll, and 2 sets of the Large Omakase Sushi set. During our ordering process, we had asked the server how many pieces of sushi come in the small and the large sets for the omakase and they responded with 5 and 10 pieces respectively.

The fried oysters we received came with very little sauce and when we bit into it there was a squirt of seawater and kind of fishy taste to it.

The J&J roll was well seasoned and each roll had a good balance of flavors and sauce. However, when you eat the fish laying on top, there was almost no flavor and almost had a hard texture to it. Something one wouldnt expect when eating raw fish.

The omakase came out with 8 pieces instead of 10 pieces as stated previously. The excuse we received was because we got to eat Otoro (fatty tuna). There was also no explanation of each piece nor sauce that we received. The sushi itself was something that you would expect out of a supermarket sushi bar, premade and refrigerated.

Per the website Tuna Bar closes at 10pm on Sunday and we got there around 8:30pm which should have been plenty of time to enjoy a meal. 

By 8:50pm it was clear the staff was ready to wrap up, soy sauce was  collected from the tables around us and we felt rushed. At 9:15pm a staff member loudly swept around our table where we were mid-meal. Frankly this was gross and disruptive. When it was barely 9:30pm chairs were brought in from outside and were stacked near our table. 

I will say Diamond was our server and she was great. The food was also good but was not easily enjoyed due to the other aspects of our experience.

My partner and I came in on a random Tuesday evening for dinner. I made a reservation via OpenTable. The space itself is beautiful and sleek - with a lot of nice accents (a lot of wood and natural textures.)

The food was delicious, too. We ordered:
- Tuna Bar Ginger Salad (larger and more substantial than expected)
- Stir Fried Soba Noodles (great flavor and a generous portion, too)
- J&J Roll (our favorite of the two rolls - would definitely order again)
- Peppered Tuna Roll (still good, but probably would skip in favor of trying something else next time.)

373,4.0,"We heard about Tuna Bar when watching the news one night. They do sushi making classes, we definitely have to check it out! We took the train down and walked a few blocks to reach the restaurant. We arrived before our reservation but were seated right away. We had a window view which made it great for people watching, but it definitely would be better in warmer weather because the windows seem like they could turn the restaurant into an open-air concept.
What we ordered: 

Chicken and shrimp dumplings: Long chives, ginger, crispy chicken skin, steamed. Just your average dumpling. Nothing too unique about it, but they were tasty nonetheless.

Wagyu Beef Spring rolls: onion, ginger, cabbage, scallions, and mustard sauce. The mustard sauce was a star of this dish.  I could honestly drink it. It went really well with the spring rolls but made the dumplings much better. We honestly wanted to order like 6 more servings of these. SO GOOD.

Eel Avocado Roll A perfect balance of eel to avocado. It had a teriyaki-ish sauce on top.

Spicy Tuna Roll  Just your normal spicy tuna roll, but it's my go-to. I definitely didn't need to eat any more sushi at this point in the meal, but I love trying them wherever I go. 

Dragon Roll: crab, avocado, cucumber, topped with fried eel and avocados. 

Dynamite White Tuna Roll: spicy walu, crunch, and shishitos.

They weren't kidding about the spice of this roll. The spice was at a good level between the spicy sauce and shishitos and the tuna seemed to balance it all out. Would definitely order this again.

 KJ Roll: seared scallops, Kani, cucumber, avocado, and wasabi aioli

Also delicious. Just the right about of heat and had a great amount of seafood in the roll

Rolls that weren't our favorite: 

Broad Street Roll: spicy salmon, avocado, crunch, soy paper, topped with king salmon and spicy salmon. No rice. 

This was the roll that our server recommended. although it was good, it was probably my least favorite roll that we ordered. I'm not sure if I ever had a roll without rice, but it felt like it was missing something texturally. If you like salmon, you should order it, but it was just meh to me.

Overall, we liked the Tuna Bar. The food and service were good, but the atmosphere was a bit loud for our liking. I think I saw that they have happy hour deals, but I know we definitely missed it by going on a Saturday night. I think the prices were reasonable for an upscale sushi joint. The drinks were a bit pricy, so we just had a drink (a Sapporo for him and Prosecco for me).",MUTTqe8uqyMdBl186RmNeA,Tuna Bar,Philadelphia,4.0,-75.1432262,39.953949,"Sushi Bars, Restaurants, Japanese","{'Tuesday': '13:30-22:0', 'Wednesday': '13:30-22:0', 'Thursday': '13:30-22:0', 'Friday': '13:30-23:0', 'Saturday': '13:30-23:0', 'Sunday': '13:30-22:0'}",205 Race St,PA

So many decor pieces and architectural aspects I love here! They had me at wrap around banquet seating in a pop of turquoise. I had a feeling I was in for a good meal from the interior design alone. I was...

First visit was for a casual, lighter lunch with my daughters and an old girlfriend which it was just perfect for! We did make ressies on Open Table which wasn't necessary for a mid week lunch, but I would suggested for dinner. 

While we stuck to some basics, they were pretty great! California, California with real crab made crispy, cucumber roll, peanut avocado (the kids' favorite!), seaweed salad, edamame, and incredible Brussels! Must order! Everything was super fresh and came out in a timely fashion. 

Service was fantastic! 
Prices were fair. 

I can't wait for my next visit perhaps for date night when I can taste some of those delicious sounding cocktails and dig into some entrees. 

I love having Tuna Bar as a new option in the Old City area just a bit away from the hustle and bustle, whether that be for lunch, happy hour (which sounded really great!), or dinner...with the kiddos, or without. It will be be on my radar for the next First Friday or after a movie at The Ritz!

I am a sushi snob having lived in NYC and Singapore for years, and this is the only place I've been to in Philly that remotely compares aside from Morimoto and Tomo. Their tuna is very fresh and high quality, the salmon and yellowtail are always very good and fresh too. They do a spicy tuna roll 'the right way' with little mayo and big pieces of sushi, as opposed to the mushy, orange paste-y consistency of most spicy tuna rolls I've had in Philly. The lobster fried rice is also very good with a fresh flavor but a little light on the lobster. I haven't tried anything else as of yet.

What sets this place apart is their happy hour and daily specials - you can't beat it anywhere in The City! Salmon avocado, spicy salmon, or spicy tuna toll for $5! You can also choose from chicken and shrimp gyozas and a couple other items for $5. Drinks specials are $5 for the cocktail special and about $4 for beer and wine. Tuesday is Tuna Tuesday where you can get tuna tartare for $7, and Wednesday is hand rolls for $5.

Drinks are steep. Like $10-15 a drink. But the drinks were strong and super creative. Since I was on a date I didn't take pics, but they were super pretty. We got the lychee (vodka, lychee, lemongrass, and sake) and the winstons heat (gin, wasabi, lemon and cucumber). Both were super refreshing. 

For the appetizers we got the creamy rock shrimp and the brussel sprouts. The shrimp portion was small but these two were probably my favorite of the night. We ended up getting a regular tuna roll along with king salmon, bluefin, and yellowtail sashimi.

This may be a bold statement, but Tuna Bar is the best sushi I've ever had (and I've tried a LOT of sushi). 

Even the atmosphere is so interesting. The lights and decor are clean and aesthetically pleasing. The hostess seated us immediately at our reservation time and handed us menus, as well as a drink menu. 

To start, we ordered Sapporo beers, a Geisha (green tea, soju, sparkling white wine, green tea flakes), and a See You Later cocktail (which had rose petals on top). I had the Geisha, and it was a great pairing with the sushi- very light but flavorful. 

For our appetizers, we split a tuna curdo (my favorite dish), tuna tartare, edamame, and a seared tuna salad. Everything was amazing and flavorful. The tuna was the best fish I've ever tasted. 

The owner of the restaurant brought us complimentary shishito peppers, as well. They're simple but delicious! I'm actually craving them now. 

For the rolls and sashimi, we ordered a variety- old city roll, white dynamite, peppered tuna roll, maguro sashimi, and a peanut avocado roll. I attached pictures of the menu that explains what's inside each.

402,5.0,"It had only been a few weeks since my last visit here, but I had the night to myself and decided I felt like traveling to Tuna Bar for dinner.  I'll admit to being a creature of habit, so no one that knows me would be surprised that tonight, absent the prodding of my wife or friends, I ordered items that I had before.  

I started with Grandmom's Wonton Soup because I needed something soothing.  I believe I tasted a very slight hint of vinegar in the broth.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but whatever it is, it provides a modern flare to the broth, to go along with the delicate and very tasty deconstructed wontons.  The dough used for the wontons is extremely light, and the sausage is more significant with great flavor.  My second course, the Wok Kampachi Ceviche, was not only as delicious as before, but this time the kampachi was a more generous serving than my earlier experience.  

Rather than a number of smaller dishes, tonight for my third course, I decided to order a larger entree.  The Salmon Shokiyaki proved to be just the right choice.  I like my cooked salmon to have a warm pink center, yet a slight crispness on the outside.  This dish was perfectly done with a warm pink center, slightly crisp, along with a glaze on it that I think may have been miso based.  I'm not sure about the glaze, but it doesn't matter because I'd order it again anyway.  

Between the food and a sampling of a few sake's, it was a great way to spend my free time.  At this restaurant, the only other thing I really wished they served might be an assortment of robatayaki.

Here are the issues, the winston's heat could have been more strain for a cocktail. While I love cucumber, there were way too many bits in the cocktail (see photo). The service was subpar. The waiter explain that he had ""forgotten"" about our salad order after nearly 35 minutes of waiting. My part visited during lunch and there must not have been more 10 people attending during our time. Ironically the salad was the best part of the meal. The ginger dressing was delish but maybe a bit over dressed. I found the rolls to be entirely too fishy and not too flavorful. Also call me skeptic, but I don't like the boxes that the sushi is served in. The little wooden rates and obviously hard to clear because we could see debris under our rolls.

404,5.0,"Vibes: simple, casual but refined, dark wooden tones, candlelit; a bit reminiscent of Double Knot's aesthetic

Menu: short, curated categories of small plates, sashimi/sushi by the piece, and rolls 

Tasting notes:
-Wok kampachi ceviche: fish was thinly sliced, lightly seared on one side, a means for picking up the strongly ginger, salty sauce; this was very much of a light but absolutely lovely appetizer
-Lobster fried rice: tender pea shoot leaves among extremely umami shiitake mushroom slices and bite-sized chunks of sweet lobster; rice was not too oily and on the chewier side; a very shareable dish
-Mai fried rice: small pieces of sweet, meaty sausage contrast with the refreshingly crisp chopped snap peas and surprisingly large, full shrimp; mixing in the runny fried egg added a subtle creaminess; cilantro is the garnish, an fyi for people who might be like me and not love the flavor
-Yellowtail house roll: kept simple with yellowtail and avocado with a little bit of garnish, very clean-tasting
-Fishtown roll: basically a rainbow roll with crunchy, sweet, firm shrimp tempura wrapped inside with a mayo sauce; the size of each piece and the ratio of fish on top to the rest of the bite (rice, shrimp) was perfect for me

Noteworthy:
-Server was very attentive and friendly and great at explaining the night's specials, down to where the seafood was sourced
-Booths good for groups and cafe-style round tables for date nights

407,4.0,"Hip, mid-century modern decorated sushi spot with some hits and some misses but overall a good time. 

Came with a party of 7 to celebrate my mom and aunt's birthday. We opted not to bring a cake because they have a $45 cake fee. 

The drinks here were strong and I quite enjoyed them. I tried the Winston's heat, which was very much cucumber-y and refreshing, the NORI-Grets, which basically tasted like a margarita, and the Yuzu sour, which was a bit too sour for me. 

We ordered a bunch of dishes for the table, which came to around $400 with tip and tax. 

Things I'd recommend:
1. UNI: the uni here was surprisingly fresh (compared to a lot of their other fish). While MP was $12 a piece, I'd say it was pretty worth it. Not sure if the UNI is always this fresh, but we definitely came on a good day. 

2. Vegetable fried rice: I'm sure all the fried rices here are good (they have 3 different choices in total, a sausage one, a crab wasabi one, and a veggie one): We opted for the veggie rice and it was delicious - Super simple, but full of flavor. A bit greasy, but definitely a delicious and straightforward dish. 

3. Grandma's Wonton soup: I didn't try this, but this was a dish ordered for my grandmother (we thought a grandma soup would be good for a grandma lol). She really enjoyed this! These are Fuzhou style wontons so they're super small, but she ate this entire dish and that doesn't happen often - so they must've been authentic and delicious! 

Things I thought that were just OKAY: 
1. The rolls: We ordered the eel avocado, California, avocado, and peanut avocado roll (lots of avocado lol). While they were pretty solid (was personally not a big fan of the peanut avocado roll), I'd say it really wasn't anything special. I guess they presented it in an aesthetic way, but definitely not any better than the regular $5 lunch special rolls at a random sushi joint. If you're a fan of sushi rolls, their rolls are definitely a safe option to order but again, they won't wow you. 

2. Oysters: My mom actually really enjoyed the oysters, so this might be a preference thing. They weren't bad by any means but I definitely didn't like that the oysters were pre-seasoned and flavored. Whenever places do that it naturally makes me question the oyster freshness. We ordered 12 oysters in total, 6 East coast and 6 west coast. The oysters were around $3, which I thought was pretty pricey - especially because dollar oysters are pretty easy to find. I pay for $3 in NYC when I've missed happy hour and am REALLLLLLLY craving oysters, otherwise I can't really justify the price - especially in Philadelphia and for the size/taste of these oysters. Again, not bad but not worth it in my book. 

3. Seaweed salad: We ordered this for my grandmother who's pretty picky with what she eats. It tasted like standard seaweed salad. Not really sure what else to say about this one. 

Things I'd skip: 
1. Tuna tartare: My cousin mentioned this was a dish that was pretty popular here so we decided to try it. Tuna didn't taste very fresh. 

2. Big tuna sashimi: Tuna, again, didn't taste fresh. I'm confused why this place is called tuna bar when their tuna doesn't seem...great. Our waiter described this as an ""omakase"" but we chose to order and share with the table. The best part of this plate was the tuna rolls. The sashimi slices were fishy and honestly the color of the fatty tuna made me feel, for lack of better words, A BIT FISHY, about this place.

Their fish and tuna truly is...whatever, but I'd still recommend this spot for a nice date or hangout with friends / family.",MUTTqe8uqyMdBl186RmNeA,Tuna Bar,Philadelphia,4.0,-75.1432262,39.953949,"Sushi Bars, Restaurants, Japanese","{'Tuesday': '13:30-22:0', 'Wednesday': '13:30-22:0', 'Thursday': '13:30-22:0', 'Friday': '13:30-23:0', 'Saturday': '13:30-23:0', 'Sunday': '13:30-22:0'}",205 Race St,PA

410,5.0,"So there seems to be some a few mixed reviews on this place and I honestly can't see why. It's a beautiful restaurant, the food and service was great and their specials were amazing. The ambience is perfect for a date night. We ordered the brussel sprouts which were nicely charred and doused in sweet and salty sauce, and the tuna tartare which isn't a super unique dish but it was done very well and it came with rice crackers to serve as a vehicle for the tuna. We also went with some happy hour rolls of spicy tuna, salmon avocado which were $5 each then a peanut avocado roll as well for $6. The peanut avocado roll is so simple and so good. I actually ordered a second one I liked it so much. I've had spicy tuna at more places than you can count, and this is exactly what you want when ordering spicy tuna. You can tell a restaurant knows what it's doing by the rice. Tuna bar knows what it's doing. Again, these aren't super original, but just done very well and a bit more refined than your typical fusion restaurant. We finished the meal with some Mochi for dessert that had 3 flavors and they were all delicious.

Drink options are: one sake (mine was only $4 and poured traditionally overflowing into a masu box), one house red and one house white wine for $7. We went with the white and it was pretty good. You have the options of 3 beers, Kirin, Kirin Lite, and Orion for $5, $4, $4 respectively. Then there's one rotating house cocktail for $7. The night we went, it was a gin martini made with craft vermouth which is a ridiculous deal for just $7. Judging the way they handled the sake alone I'm sure their bar program is excellent. I will return to confirm this.

Happy hour food: 3 rolls for $5 each, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, and Salmon Avocado. There's also chicken and shrimp dumplings for $7, edamame for $4 and shrimp and oysters for $2 a piece. 

Bonus tip: (as far as I know) every Tuesday is Tuna Tuesday. Spicy tuna rolls are $6 all day and tuna tartare is $7. Every Thursday is Toro Thursday. Negitoro rolls are $7 all day.

Food was amazing. Loved the Fried Brussel Sprouts that were seasoned with sesame oil and miso - nice Asian flare. Tuna Tartare was good and had lots of avocado. Kobe Beef Spring Rolls (it was a special and I just had to try it) had a decent amount of meat in them and came with a dipping sauce.

Grandmom's Wonton Soup - our friends raved about this so we each got a bowl. This is FuZhou style - I laughed when I read it on the menu because I am from FuZhou and this is a traditional soup that my grandma would ACTUALLY make for us eat all the time at home, or you could buy it for like less than a dollar in noodle shops. It was funny to see it being served at an upscale place like this for $8 bucks. It was delicious nonetheless and a nice warming appetizer.

We ordered a bunch of sushi and rolls afterwards and they brought it out all together on a huge wooden tray for us to share (presentation def did not disappoint).

We started with: (1) Grandma's Wonton Soup (traditional fuzhou style pork wontons, scallions, celery), which was delightful--a very gentle broth and ghost-like wontons floating therein; (2) Pork Gyoza (kurobuta pork, scallions, ginger, pan-fried), which were nicely crisp, flavorful, and served piping hot; and (3) Wagyu Beef Spring Rolls (onion, ginger, cabbage, scallions, mustard sauce), which included some delicious beef, however, the beef overwhelmed the rest of the spring roll.

We rolled on with: (a) Yellowtail & Chives house roll (avocado, chive oil), my favorite roll of the evening--that chive oil gave it a certain special something; (b) King Ghidorah specialty maki (spicy tuna, shishitos, hot sesame oil, topped with yellow-tail, jalapeño, tobiko), my second favorite roll; (c) Dynamite White Tuna house roll (spicy walu, crunch, shishitos), my third favorite roll; (d) Fishtown specialty maki (shrimp tempura, avocado, jalapeño, topped with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, spicy aioli), although this roll looked like it would have the most flavor, it didn't deliver on its looks, tasty, sure, but not my favorite; and (e) Eel Avocado classic maki.

I actually ate there two nights in a row so that I could get a true taste of the cuisine.  The Wok Kampachi Ceviche was excellent but my favorite was the Scallop Crudo.

First, I love the ambience. This is a place that suits many occasions, first dates, get together with friends, lunch with a coworker, etc. I would say definitely more of an intimate setting, I came here with Megan F. for a lunch during a work break! Such great vibes. Love the bar area and full length windows, just adds to the ambience! 

We tried their steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings as an appetizer and for rolls we split the J&J roll, peppered tuna roll, and the east roll. The east roll is just your standard salmon sushi roll, nothing too crazy.  The J&J is a great roll for people trying to transition into the sushi eating world of actual raw fish! Loved the seared tuna on the outside. Hands down, our favorite was the peppered tuna roll! I'm a spicy tuna roll enthusiast and I decided to switch it up with this roll. I have zero regrets, a definite must try and great chance of tuna palette.

We also did the spicy salmon and eel avocado, which I'm happy about. Overall, service was super fast!! We ordered 4 rolls and it came out in what felt like less than 5 minutes! And then we ordered one more roll and that was in front of us in about 2 minutes. Incredible.

440,5.0,"Wow... simply speechless. Tuna Bar is hands down the best restaurant for sushi in Philly. 

5/5 STARS!

Food: First and foremost, their food is amazing. I have been to many sushi spots in the greater city and Philadelphia area but Tuna Bar's sushi has the best overall quality and taste. Their speciality rolls are to die for. My personal favorites are the Sindy Roll, Rittenhouse Roll, and Hurts Roll. As for favorite appetizers, it is definitely the tuna flatbread and their oysters. Yum. 
 
Drinks and Cocktails: The best part about going to an amazing restaurant for food is having an amazing alcohol and drink selection to complement the meal. Personal favorite cocktails are the yuzu sour and the race street. If you're a sake fan then definitely ask them about their wide variety of sake. Cheers! 

Ambience: The ambience and the atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing. The ""vibes"" are great. They are always playing great music that sets a positive mood for everyone. Big ups to whomever created that playlist! 

Service: Last but certainly not the least, their service. Simply wow. Tuna bar has the best service. I have to give Ken, the owner, a thumbs up for creating such an amazing establishment with an amazing team. Their General Manager, Tina, was phenomenal. Her professionalism, positive attitude, and seasoned experience can be seen from a mile away. I remember on a busy Saturday night, she was juggling 5 things at once, but still managed to provide my family and I an amazing time. She was super friendly! The rest of the staff were A+ too! 

Would I go again? YES YES YES.

I would definitely recommend making a reservation, especially on a weekend, as the place was pretty packed when my dining companion and I arrived. 

The menu is relatively small, but from our experience, everything was made with thought and care. We started off with cocktails, the tequila for us both. While the smell let us know it was a generous pour, it was easy to drink and not overly sweet. We split 4 rolls in total: Fishtown, peppered tuna, dynamite tuna, and spicy salmon. The presentation was beautiful, and every roll was delicious, although my favorite was the Fishtown. It was clear that all of the fish and other ingredients were fresh!

446,1.0,"Will never return.  I must have been to Tuna Bar at least 10 times last year.  However my last experience was the most atrocious experience I have ever had.  I understand that it was the first opening day and some hiccups are to be expected, but Friday is quite beyond.  First we arrived at our reservation time of 7:30.  Once we arrived we were told by the very disheveled matradee that they were running about 30 minutes late.  No issue so we took a walk around the block.  We arrived back at 8 and were told we were the 2nd table to be seated after 1 couple and they were cleaning 2 tables at that moment.  We sat on the bench at which point I watched him seat 2 couples.  Then another customer who showed up later than us went and said something and he sat them at a 4 top.  At that point I went back up and he looked at his computer and couldn't find my name. He eventually found it and looked confused.  He said I'll be the next couple and said here's a $25 gift card.  It was only $15 when I opened at home.  We waited another 15 minutes at which point a waiter started going to everyone including us to tell us they were out of food.  

There were multiple chances to tell us they would be out.  Instead we waited and waited, watched other people be seated when we were due to be next.  I rather write to you directly then putting my review on social sites as I think you should know about my full experience.  The waiter did give us a $50 gift card as he did with others for running out of food.    I emailed the restaurant direct with no response.

447,3.0,"Atmosphere - 5/5 

Beautifully designed space, with a nice ambience to it. Music is neither too loud nor soft. Logo is simple and nice. Menu has a nice feel with minimalistic approach in design. Overall, the interior design is one of my favorite things about this place.

Service - 3/5

Host is friendly and the waiters are nice. Nothing extraordinary. The only thing I thought (and maybe it wasn't appropriate for me to expect?) was that there would be an introduction to the sushi sampler/omakase we ordered. I'm clearly not a sushi expert so I had no idea what I was eating, but I kind of wish I did. I guess I was used to an intro/story typically offered at other sushi places for an omakase.

Food - 3/5

What I ordered the few times I've been here:
Rittenhouse Roll, J&J, Omakase/Sushi Sampler & Fried Oysters 

The rolls were great. I enjoyed the Rittenhouse Sq Roll thoroughly and the J&J was good to taste. The fried oysters and sushi samplers weren't my favorite. The fried oysters were too sea watery for my taste, and the sushi samplers didn't feel too fresh to me.

Price - 2/5

For the price of the food, I would expect a little more from the food and service itself. The interior design matches what I would expect in pricing.

448,4.0,"Service was great - trendy spot in Old city! They have plenty of seating for any size group. There's the sushi bar as well as a full alcohol bar with seating to be at. There are small 2 seater ""booths"" that would be cute for dates  as well as large tables that have a mix of a sofa seating as well as chairs. 

They do take opentable reservations! However, when we got there, it wouldn't have been an issue to get a table - but we also went at 8 Pm on a Wednesday:) 

Starters:

Blood orange fluke - best part of the meal. The fluke was so gooood and went really well with the capers, blood orange, and radish pieces! I couldn't get enough! A must ORDER!! 

Rock shrimp: this was good as well!! I liked it because it wasn't coveredddd in sauce or heavily fried. It was the perfect balance of sauce and batter  - there was radish pieces as well - which I loved! Gave it a nice, refreshing crunch to your bite. 

Lobster rice - this was just your usual fried rice ... with lobster and mushrooms. Some at my table said it was too salty - I think it was the mushrooms - but the rice itself was decent. I'd order it if I wanted fried rice ‍

Soba noodles with shrimp - this was good too. My pick over the rice, actually. However, we had this after the rock shrimp and fluke - and those seemed to be the best! 

Sushi: 

Sushi was decent. But nothing heavenly delicious. I have yet to find a good sushi place in Philly  however, the starters were really good, which would make me want to go back and try the other dishes besides the sushi. Sushi wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. But good place to go to take care of that sushi craving! 

The sushi that we tried....

J&J : this was the best out of the 3 we got. It tasted fresh and flavorful. It had a bit of a rich taste which made you feel full after 2! 
Broad street: this was okay. Too many ingredients made the sushi feel soggy and the flavors didn't seem to have .... flavor. Just wasn't a good combo, in my opinion.
Dynamite : your typical rollllll- which isn't a bad thing.

The bar menu was small but each drink was really interesting. It's clear that they are committed to craft cocktails and keeping an upscale bar. Our waiter also informed us that a lengthy sake menu will be arriving soon.  

The food was delicious! Started with the rock shrimp. Perfect. Moved on to the lobster fried rice which was extremely flavorful and not at all greasy. Had a few rolls for our main course all of which were extremely fresh and with a good rice to fish ratio.

I would like to see more choices with another type of fish, but can't complain too much hence the name, Tuna Bar. 

Although the food was amazing, the service could be better. It took a little longer for our server to come check on us after the food came out. It was later in the evening, so I figured they were busy closing out on a few other tables - fair enough. However, we were then not checked on again for another 30-40 minutes after we were done eating. We all kind of just sat there with empty plates and water glasses wondering if we should ask the hostess to track them down.

We started with edemame, tuna tartar, tuna curdo and seared tuna salad. They were all amazing but my favorite was the tuna curdo which is basically thin slices of raw tuna in a delicious sauce. Order this app it's incredible.

Moving on to the rolls... We had the old city roll, white dynamite, peppered tuna and some yellowtail sashimi. Let me repeat the quality of fish they serve he is the best I have had period. All of these rolls were extremely tasty but my favorite was the peppered tuna! It comes with an amazing wasabi drizzle and the tuna is pepper crusted.

We also had a few Sapporo beers and the ladies had cocktails the geisha and the I'll see you lata. They said the cocktails were Great!

We had such a good time and enjoyed the food so much that we told the owner it was the best sushi we ever had.

461,4.0,"Stopped by here Friday on a whim after checking out the art galleries in the area. Was able to sit at the bar due to a wait for tables but understandable. The bar is made out of pieces of wood that kinda scream Fixer Upper is on the DVR. The vibe of the place was urban and perfect for its location. For apps we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Tuna Crudo, Miso Soup and the Pork Gyoza. 

The Miso was $6 bucks, when I asked my companion was it $6 bucks worthy there was a reply of lacking flavor but the size was equivalent to 2 $3 bowls somewhere else. 
The Brussel Sprouts: Now I confess I hadn't had brussel sprouts since at least 12 and that pushing it but I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try them roasted instead of boiled and I am now a fan. The sesame oil was perfect and they were charred just enough to elicit the flavor of the sprouts to be slightly sweet.
Tuna Crudo: My companions loved this dish and advised the truffle oil was slightly overwhelming but delectable.
Pork Gyoza: Always good and great with the left over truffle oil

The perk of sitting at the bar was watching the chefs make the rolls and trying to figure out which one was ours. There is a mirror above the bar and more than once did we find ourselves staring at what was going on. We ordered 4 rolls to share: Fishtown, Old City, J&J and the Real California. The J&J was my favorite the shishito pepper would kick in right at the end for a spicy finish. The Old City looked to be the most popular coming off the bar and it made sense - its a instagramable plate in its own right and has a good flavor combo. I initially ordered the Fishtown and depending on what piece of fish you got on top kinda determined if it worked in my opinion. We decided to try the Real California roll for fun and honestly I could have done without.

Overall I liked it and would try it again. I do wonder if they are going to rotate rolls to keep it fresh.",MUTTqe8uqyMdBl186RmNeA,Tuna Bar,Philadelphia,4.0,-75.1432262,39.953949,"Sushi Bars, Restaurants, Japanese","{'Tuesday': '13:30-22:0', 'Wednesday': '13:30-22:0', 'Thursday': '13:30-22:0', 'Friday': '13:30-23:0', 'Saturday': '13:30-23:0', 'Sunday': '13:30-22:0'}",205 Race St,PA

Had the shishito peppers, always a big fan of that. Blistered up with a simple soy sauce.

Had the different oysters, it was fresh and delicious. Wasabi fried rice was good, enough wasabi to give you that kick I like.
I forgot which sushi rolls i've tried but they were all good and packed with flavor.
Tried the toro and it was melt in your mouth goodness.

464,3.0,"This place gets 10/5 for ambiance! It's in a great location and it's so modern inside and provides a great atmosphere for a girls night, date night, friend date, family date, etc. etc. etc. Outdoor seating is available. They have the ceiling to floor doors that they open wide during a nice night which gives you the feel of eating outside even when you are dining indoors. It's relatively small inside so I definitely recommend making a reservation if our plan to come at a busy time. 

The service was good. A little slow but we weren't in a rush so it worked for us.

We came during happy hour and got two spicy tuna rolls and two spicy salmon rolls (which are $5 each at happy hour prices). It took a while for them to come out. I actually thought she forgot about them. They were just ok. 

My friend got the edamame which she enjoyed. I got a ginger salad. It said it had avocado so I assumed they were just trying to be different by calling it a ginger salad instead of an avocado salad. Most sushi restaurants that I go to have an avocado salad on the menu with ginger dressing and it has at least a half of an avocado on top. This salad came out almost immediately after I ordered it and it was super cold which makes me feel like it's one of those restaurants that pre-makes salads and keeps them in a fridge or cooler. The avocado was so sparse I barely even knew it was in there. Not what I'm used to! To be fair, I assumed it was the avocado salad that I get at other sushi restaurants. 

We split the lobster fried rice because so many people raves about it in the reviews. It was decent. Not amazing. It was kind of egg-y; I felt like that was the dominant flavor. 

The other special rolls I ordered are pretty forgettable. One was a KJ, I believe. That's all I really remember. I don't remember what the other one was even called or what was in either of them. What's not forgettable is the price point of these unforgettable rolls. Their special rolls cost $15 to $21 per roll. ($21? Seriously?) They were falling apart as we tried to pick them up with the chopsticks. The wasabi was more mild than I'm used to. 

The bathrooms are individual rooms for one person at a time. There was different music playing in the bathroom and it felt like a dance party. I was jamming out in there. Lol. 

There is kiosk parking located nearby. Just a short walk will get you there. I'm not sure of any lots. 

This place is great for the atmosphere but I've had wayyyyyy better sushi at a way lower price point. I feel like you are paying for the location more than anything. While I loved the ambiance, I don't really know that it would be worth returning to. I have sushi so infrequently that if I'm in the mood for it, I would rather go somewhere with better sushi and maybe not as awesome of an environment than mediocre, overpriced sushi in a modern, breezy location.

I recently went to this restaurant for my birthday dinner. Upon entering the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh, clean, modern, and beautiful the restaurant was. After sitting for 10 minutes, I noticed that my date and I still had not been approached by any server. Finally, after getting our drink and dinner order in, we received our food. The first two courses were served promptly, the last main course, not so prompt. Honestly, the food was just average. This disappointed me as I was expecting the food to match the beautiful decor.  I was also not impressed with the lack of service. I really had high hopes for this place but it let my partner and I down in two crucial areas: food and service.

Tuna crudo was clean and tasty and I would definitely order it again when I come back. 

I loved my nigiri pieces, cut well and tasted great.  Not sure why they didn't dab a bit of wasabi under the fish but I adjusted my own wasabi so no biggie..  My wife's Sindy roll was very tasty by fell apart way too easily. 

Very modern casual ambiance and pleasant staff made for a great overall experience.

Located at the heart of Old City near the pier, Tuna Bar is a great upscale Japanese restaurant, perfect for dates. They offer both indoor and outdoor seating. The place itself looks very classy and modern. Their menu have a large selection, prices are a bit on the higher end but you are getting fresh, qualify fish. Not only is the food delicious but  the presentation is also just as nice. I loved that the rolls comes in a wooden tray. Also they have pretty good green tea that they serve in a steeping pot. Be prepared to spend a good lump sum while you're here.

*LUNCH*
- Tuna Tartare - Fresh tuna and avocado. I love the rick crackers that they serve this dish with

- Gyoza - pretty standard gyoza, though the skin was not as fried and crispy as I've had at other places.

- Broad Street - Salmon is my favorite fish and this roll literally was all I could ever ask for. The salmon was so fresh and the the sauce made the roll. No need for soy sauce or wasabi or any other additional, good as is.

Cleanliness- the menus were all paper and it looked very unprofessional due to all the wrinkles and sauce spill. The wine glass were very dusty. The spoon for our fried rice had a hair/fuzzy on it.

Food- Sad to say, the lobster fried rice was the best part of our dinner. The wagyu beef and west coast uni was good and kinda what we expected. The king salmon ($9) and otoro ($16) was such a disappointment. Both did not taste like the fish we wanted. The quality and presentation didn't match up to what we wanted. We eat sushi very often so we know what it look like and should taste like. That was not worth the money at all. We also had the chicken and shrimp dumplings, it was okay, very strong shrimp taste.

The first time, we were very impressed by the quality of the fish and the preparation of our food. The second time, the quality was still very good but it wasn't prepared as well as the first time we visited. Since this restaurant is fairly expensive, we were slightly disappointed. 

The food we ordered included miso soup, tuna tartare, Old City Roll, Fishtown roll, White Tuna Roll, and Spicy Salmon Roll. We really enjoyed the tuna tartare and the Old City Roll, although the rock shrimp on Old City Roll were not cooked as tender as the first time we went. The fish in the other rolls was very good quality, but we were not too impressed by the overall rolls themselves. 

Most recently we were here on a Thursday and there was supposedly a happy hour on the lychee martini that featured the drink for $5. We were told when we sat down around 7pm that the happy hour was still going on and we could order the martini with the discounted price, which we did. The martini was delicious, however, when we went to pay the bill, our drinks were listed as full price and the same waitress we had since he beginning of the meal told us that we ordered after the happy hour was over. Therefore I would say the service we received was not the best...

485,4.0,"I was excited to see Tuna Bar open in my Old City neighborhood. Adding a Japanese restaurant to the neighborhood seemed like a great idea even though I'm not a fan of sushi. I hoped it would also have food for non sushi lovers and thankfully it does. 

Upon walking in i noticed the restaurant has a nice warm modern decor. I ordered a bunch of items with my dinner companion and we shared. We ordered dumplings, edamame, lobster fried rice, shrimp tempura sushi, and bone-in steak. The dumplings were good, but not as flavorful as the best dumplings I've tasted. The lobster fried rice was the standout. It's a large delicious bowl, with enough lobster to actually taste, and you have plenty to take home at the end. The steak was a perfectly cooked and juicy medium. But it was a fatty piece of steak. I had to trim some of the fat myself, which was slightly annoying. But once the fat was trimmed I was in steak heaven.  Remember, I'm not a fan of sushi but I did enjoy the shrimp tempura sushi. Guess I can like sushi as long as the fish is cooked. I also had a rum & coke, which was mixed well but missing the lime. The bar probably focuses on fancier cocktails as opposed to the old classics.

Peanut avocado rolls - good but wouldn't get again
Cooked:
Creamy rock shrimp - would def get again
Wentz/Hurts Rolls - would get again because I don't eat raw and there's not too many cooked rolls options 
Wasabi fried rice - we split between 2 people and it's hard for me to have wasabi but I managed to enjoy enough of it. It's light but you still do feel it in your nose. 

Has raw fish so I did not try but am told they were very good and they looked very good to me. Wish there could be cooked fish versions:
Old City rolls
Geisha rolls

Very nice restaurant setting. Too cold though because of the fans above. AC was already on so not sure why the fans were needed. Very good service and everything prompt. Food was also quick to come out. Pricey though, for two people this was about $100. Can't dine in too often, we'll probably do more takeout of smaller orders.

489,4.0,"I feel like there's no in between with sushi restaurants-  it's either your go to questionable delivery place for a $10 3 roll special, or it's high class fish with high class price tag at a place like Tuna Bar. 

The Bar in Tuna Bar is on point- I loved my first cocktail- The Picante (a mezcal drink with grapefruit and jalapeno), but the second cocktail was odd- wasabi and cucumber just tasted like someone blended a cucumber roll, and the wasabi chunks at the bottom were weird.

The Tuna in Tuna Bar is on par with Morimoto, Royal Izakaya and and Double Knot. Beware of the specials though, those prices add up! We had a 3 piece fatty tuna special for $21 and 2 piece yellowtail for $20. That's $41 for 5 pieces of fish. Coulda had 12 mediocre takeout rolls for that price, so it's hard to wrap my head around. But it was really good! They also had some fun looking fancy rolls and we tried the Fishtown Roll -with jalapeno and assorted fish wrapped around shrimp tempura which was very good.

We also enjoyed some apps and sides- the bang bang shrimp, brussel sprouts, lobster fried rice (large portion), and the wok fried crudo were all very good. Before we knew it our check was about $100 each. Not sure if there was dessert, since our waiter just brought the check and rushed us out a bit....

The place was busy on a Thursday night, despite it being in a bit of an odd location). The waiters seemed a bit stressed and the area they had to navigate was so narrow they seemed to constantly be excusing themselves or squeezing past each other.

The house special for happy hour was $7 which is amazing and it was a Pomegranate  cosmo, which wasn't too sweet at all.

They ended up needing our table though right after we had paid, and what makes this place 5 stars ++ for me is that they offered to move us to the bar and give us another round of drinks on the house for moving.

Do book a reservation. We were glad to have one as the restaurant filled up completely within a half hour of our arrival. Servers seemed to be a little stressed and we had to flag our server down a couple times when we needed something after our initial order.

I typically stick with wine or vodka martinis when I have sushi, but after tasting my friend's cocktail I ordered the same. It was a mezcal drink with lime and jalapeño syrup that was absolutely delicious. My friend later ordered a gin martini with wasabi - the taste was really fresh and interesting but the wasabi wasn't mixed in well and she encountered a few larger nuggets which made the drink a little weird. 

We ordered several plates and highlights for me were the lobster fried rice, crispy rock shrimp, fishtown roll and one of the specials of the day, some fresh yellowtail, which was absolutely incredible. 

If there is dessert on the menu, we wouldn't know, because our check was dropped without us even asking for it. Not exactly the warm vibe I'm expecting when spending upwards of $100/person.

When I say early dinner, I'm talking 5pm which means we made it just in time for happy hour. Their happy hour deals include wines, one of their signature cocktails (I believe it was a whiskey cocktail on the day that we went) and a select few bites. Although we passed on their drink specials, we did order their $6 dumplings and a spicy salmon roll. As for drinks, we both ordered off of the cocktail list. She got the Shiso Picate which comes with mezcal and jalapeño and I got the Winston's Heat with gin, wasabi and cucumber. We both loved our drinks - so much so that we were happy to get a second round!

Aside from the happy hour food that we got, we also ordered the fried Brussels sprouts, Tuna Tartare, and the Fishtown roll. The Brussels sprouts came in a fairly large bowl and were fantastic. I'm a huge fan of Brussels sprouts and and these were some of the best I've had in Philly - and trust me I've had my fair share! The tuna was a choice my friend made and it was also very good.

The space is awesome - a mix of retro 50s diner/with modern and sophisticated touches.  It was so quiet - I think because it's so new.  We were the only ones in there from 9:30PM on.  The staff and service were fantastic.  Our waiter, Brion, was attentive to our needs and quick to provide recommendations (which turned out incredible!).  Ken Sze, the owner/executive chef also came out towards the end of our meal to make sure we were happy and satisfied.  We chatted with him on our way out and he was very pleasant!  

Onto the food!  We had a number of appetizers.  We tried the scallop crudo on recommendation and this was one of the best dishes of the night.  This MELTS in your mouth.  You must have this.  We also had the pork gyoza, creamy rock shrimp, mai fried rice, and wagyu beef egg rolls.  All were delicious and would highly recommend.  The wagyu beef egg rolls were on special but I asked that they put it on the full menu when it is released!  

We got 4 sushi rolls- the Old City, Fishtown, Spicy Salmon, and California roll.  All were absolutely delectable - super fresh, and really flavorful.  We finished off with ice cream for the table - the chocolate and the green tea.  So rich and creamy!

Overall, our experience was awesome and this is such a great addition to the Philly sushi scene.  I will definitely be coming back.

I like that they do happy hour at the tables as well - so much more comfortable when there are 4+ people in your party. Their happy hour food specials are great - three types of rolls, and not eensy ones either. The four of us split seven rolls and two bowls of edamame between us, and I was pretty full. We also got two rounds of sake, and the total was about $80 - not bad at all. They also had a happy hour cocktail (sounded too sweet for me), and wine, not sure about beer. But I'm glad I went with the sake - maybe a bit kitschy, but I love how they pour and let the excess spill over into a box. The server was very polite and helpful even though we were probably not making his life easy (not all arriving at the same time, not ordering all the food at the same time, squeezing in a second happy hour round, etc.).

We started with edemame, tuna tartar, tuna curdo and seared tuna salad. They were all amazing but my favorite was the tuna curdo which is basically thin slices of raw tuna in a delicious sauce. Order this app it's incredible.

Moving on to the rolls... We had the old city roll, white dynamite, peppered tuna and some yellowtail sashimi. Let me repeat the quality of fish they serve he is the best I have had period. All of these rolls were extremely tasty but my favorite was the peppered tuna! It comes with an amazing wasabi drizzle and the tuna is pepper crusted.

We also had a few Sapporo beers and the ladies had cocktails the geisha and the I'll see you lata. They said the cocktails were Great!

We had such a good time and enjoyed the food so much that we told the owner it was the best sushi we ever had.

It's not particularly traditional, but it does have the basic spirit of bibimbap:  take a bunch of leftover vegetables and turn it into something new.

I've had my fair share of Korean rice in stone pots that have warmed my soul and whet my appetite. This came to me in a large aluminum bowl to accentuate the size of the meal. I wasn't completely wowed even knowing full well the guy prepared it just there and then. Good assortment of veggies, rice, meat but definitely echo some of the other reviewers here - it just wasn't enough. Typically bibimbap makes me keel over from sheer amazingness; quality and quantity and delicious. This gave me more of an: it's alright, feels sufficient.

There's not much to say really: it's exactly what you'd expect Bibimbap to be. The menu is small. It's basically Bibimbap and then Kimchi with some specials that change from time to time. The only negative, but not enough to take off a point, is that the portion sizes are quite small for what you pay. I always order extra meat and it still doesn't fill me up. I'm not even a big eater.

On the other hand, if you can't adequately prepare a dish, don't offer it on your menu!  

This pajeon, a sort of egg+vegetable concoction, was tasteless, utterly without taste!  I couldn't even taste the vegetables that I could actually see in the pancake!  There also appeared to be something similar to cornmeal in the pancake.

This place is literally the best, most authentic korean food I've had thus far in philadelphia. They offer only a limited menu of bibimbap (with various proteins), pajeon (scallion pancake), and yuk gae jang (beef stew), but they do it right! I think it's advertised as a take-out joint, but the actual restaurant is a hole in a wall spot on south st that seats about 8-10 people, max. I saw the glowing reviews and though skeptical, decided to bike down here with a friend for dinner and was not disappointed. The pajeon was smaller than I imagined, but delicious and surprisingly filling - certainly enough to hold you over until the main dish. I love traditional bibimbap, and BAP does it SO SO well. I always get the classic marinated beef as my protein, and this particular version comes with soybean, carrots, cucumbers, mushroom, cabbage, a gooey egg, and broccoli! I would HIGHLY recommend paying the extra dollar for the dolsot option to get that crunchy rice on the bottom for more flavor! Love this place and will definitely be back whenever I need my korean food fix! Maybe I'll try the yuk gae jang next time!

i have had both the beef and the chicken to go

i would say that the sauce is nice and punchy but i wish there were a little more of it and that it had a good dose of sesame oil and at least the beef version should have a sprinkling of sesame seeds on top

both the beef and chicken could have been more seasoned and i wish there was a small side of kimchi

but given that the veggie portion (which is actually more important than the meat in a dish like this) was quite extensive and done well, i would definitely suggest this for vegetarian friends (veggie or tofu)

Definitely cozy with seating for perhaps 12, but the atmosphere and decor are nice (not sterile or uncomfortable like a cheap Americanized Chinese restaurant.

Their regular bibimbap is $7.95 to $9.95 (veggie v. meats). If you want it in a hot stone pot (dolsot bibimbap), its $1 extra. Perks of dolsot - the stone pot crisps up the bottom of the rice which adds a great texture. However, the hot stone pot cooled quickly and I didn't feel like I got enough of a crisp on my rice. Of note, it comes pre-mixed with the sauce, which I wasn't expecting. Meanwhile, if you order the regular it does not come pre-mixed so the vegetables/meat are separated and you can decide how much hot sauce you want to mix in. For this reason, I'd probably get the regular next time.

My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken dolsot bibimbap and the vegetable dolsot bibimbap. Not the best bibimbap I've ever had. Since it came pre-mixed, it's very similar to spicy fried rice, especially since I didn't get enough crispy rice. They all come topped with an over-easy egg, the yolk of which makes a great sauce. For $9.95 and $10.95 it was a bit pricey, since the portions are not very large. We also ordered the seafood pancake, which was delicious, but again a bit pricey since it didn't taste like it was made from scratch.

Overall, lovely little spot.

So why not 5 stars?

My wannabe Korean roots tell me that this should be served in a hot stone bowl if I am eating in ( FYI: only 6 seats in this establishment) . I love to here that sizzle of the rice cooking. However, cute old korean men cook it in a hot-stone in the kitchen and reassemble it in an alternative bowl. So, this was a disappointment. However, the flavors are all there.

670,4.0,"3.5 stars (3 stars for food, 4 stars for price, service) 

BAP is a no frills traditional Korean food establishment that has been doing takeout this pandemic. The menu is just a few items long and largely consists of different types of bibimbap, all under $10. Ordering was really effortless -- I called ahead with my order for a vegetable and chicken bibimbap and it was ready within 15 minutes. Pickup was also easy and done at a window in the front of the store with a really nice elderly man who I assume is one of the owners. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they gave us free coffee packets which I have since used (I love me some Vietnamese iced coffee). 

The food itself was okay. With the price point, the speed of service, and the no frills menu, I assume the bibimbap is meant to compete with other fast food options, and as a result it should be critiqued as such. Within this category of food, BAP provides a light, healthy, and balanced alternative, which I appreciated. However I think the portion size of the vegetable one was a little small and the flavor slightly bland. You'd do better with spending that extra dollar for additional tofu or meat. Overall, though, it was fine for a $9 bibimbap if you're looking for it.

What I found was that this place was a nice little mom and pop joint where there was a sense of simple foods but in a contemporary area.
I've had my fare share of korean food while in philly, Los Angeles, New York and houston.
Honestly speaking. . . It is a standard price for korean food. A little higher than other joints. In all I spent over 15 dollars for a bowl of beef bibimpop and veggie pancake.
First the pancake. I didn't like that it was very eggy compared to all that I have tried. It lacked crispness and it lacked. . . Flavor. It was as if it was reheated, although I'm not sure. It wasn't hot and it wasn't crunchy and it wasn't tasty.
As for my bibimpop I wasn't impressed. It was very standard for 11 bucks. The veggies were assorted and it tastes exactly what it looks like, if you want the crispy bowl it jacks up to 12 bucks.

I kind of like the concept of a stand alone bibimbap place. The dining area of the restaurant isn't currently open, so you can call in an order or walk up. I walked up and ordered and received my food relatively quickly.

I ordered the dolsot bibimbap with beef. I didn't know how the dolsot bibimbap was made without the stone bowl, which usually cooks the rice while your eating, so you can a nice crust around your rice towards the end of your meal. Basically the dolsot bibimbap to go was mimicking that experience with frying the ingredients before serving. At first, I thought the portion size was a bit small, but after eating it, I was surprised how filling it was. The gochujang or hot sauce was mixed in. The food was cooked well and it tasted great. It had a good amount of spice.

The only compaint I had about this place was that it's a bit pricey for my specific order. It was close to $14 for a relatively small rice dish.

The biggest disappointment for BAP is the food, which is tragic. I love Korean food, and I fancy Bibimbap and korean pancakes. However, both versions at BAP were just a few notes short. The pancakes were dry and thick and fairly bland. The bibimbap, granted we got the regular version (non hot pot), was served almost at cool-room temperature without any close attention to how the flavors and texture coexisted with each other. The Japchae (noodle) was the greatest disappointment as it was served with a larger and too generous portion of white rice without any other sustenance. 

Objectively, the food was underwhelming, but if you take in the whole picture, the small and unassuming quaint place settings, you'd have a good time.

This place only serves bibimbap, pajeon, a soup, and japchae. Truly bare bones menu, with no banchan (side dishes) served. Additionally, there's limited seating -- maybe like 15 people tops? 

But what they make, they make well and cheaply! My stone bowl beef bibimbap set me back ~$8-9, and it was delicious. 

This bibimbap is a little different from others in that the spicy red sauce that usually comes on the side is actually premixed in stone bowl bibimbap. This means it's a little spicier than normal bibimbap. The regular (non stone bowl) bibimbap has plain rice.

712,2.0,"So expensive for what it is! I am surprised at all the high star reviews. I got the beef bibimbop and was disappointed at the quantity and the quality. I got take out and the portion was small. The ingredients didn't even fill to the brim and they even skimped on the rice. 

The dish just tasted ""too homemade"" to me but NOT homemade in a good way. It tasted ""homemade"" like it was made by a cook that had only okay culinary skills (not homemade like your grandma's cooking). It lacked flavor and presentation. The rice was too sticky. The veggies looked limpy and tasted boring (blocky stir-fried cucumbers pieces, carrots not meticulously julienned, spinach just boiled but not seasoned). The beef pieces weren't even restaurant quality, not tender at all. The gochujang was the same stuff you can buy from the Korean super market with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I could probably make the same at home fairly easily using only oil, salt, and sesame seeds as seasoning and no advanced marinades, special sauces, or knife skills.

It didn't taste terrible, but it was underwhelming compared to bibimbop I've had at other Korean restaurants. I don't know about you but I eat out to experience dishes I cannot recreate (or would take significant effort to recreate) at home. For what you get, they should just charge $6 for a plain boxed lunch, not $10!

The cinnamon iced tea is also nothing to rave about. It just tastes like weak homemade generic green tea with cinnamon dumped in. The cinnamon doesn't even compliment the tea! $3 a bottle, too! In case you were wondering, unsweetened. Unsweetened cinnamon tastes disgusting/pointless, at least sweeten your damn tea.

I feel like this place is trying too hard to have that specialty/gourmet mom-and-pop feel, marketed towards boogie hipster patrons but the quality/creativity is just not there. I feel super ripped off!

Don't come here because it ""looks cute"" or because you like ""hole in the wall"" restaurants. Usually hole in the wall restaurants serve brilliant food but this one is not one of them.

This place is a very small restaurant with very limited menus, but as an one-time customer, there were definitely enough choices to choose from. I got the vegetable bibimbap. The food came very quickly and even though at first glance, it looked very little, it was actually quite filling. There was a good ratio of vegetable to rice and the sauce was definitely a good kick of flavour. The staff was very nice. 

The only downside was that it was pretty expensive for just one bowl of rice. I know it was a bit cheaper than other places that serve bibimbap by around ~$1-2 but there were no side dishes served at this place, which I thought made the price not as worth it even if it was cheaper by a bit.

I initially saw the place was highly rated so I went to check it out and what's not to like? Rice, choice of protein, veggies, fried egg, etc... it's a healthy and complete meal. Since I've left Philly, I haven't found bibimbap anywhere else in the US that's been as good. It's genuinely exceptional, whether you opt for the stone pot (dolsot) or not. 

But the real kicker here isn't just the amazing food- it's the man behind it all. Francis is special- he's a great chef but an even better person. By running this restaurant, he's helped put his daughter through college and grad school, and supported his family altogether. I'm so happy to see all his hard work paying off! After over 3 years of not seeing each other once I moved, he remembered me as soon as I walked in today.

Secondly, if you're a tea drinker, you're out of luck. They don't serve the tea in pots, but huge, sloppy individual filters--it makes your beverage totally ungainly, hard to drink and is really off putting.

Something about the wooden interior, the expansive seating areas and trendy wallpaper makes it a place where I'd want to sit and relax.

Joe and I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty bustling from what would have expected. Another plus: their menu is extensive, serving up specialty drinks as well (Credo, please expand, I can't drink straight coffee!). ROAST also serves food and wine after 4pm, which makes me want to return ASAP!

For that day though, we were happy with our drinks. Joe and his regular latte, decorated with their signature 'R' (to go, because he just had a cup of coffee with breakfast), and a dark chocolate mocha for me. This is the first time I've ever had a mocha where I didn't find was too bitter (aside from anything served at Starbucks, pure cream and sugar). Absolutely loved my drink!

I was disappointed when they took their maple bacon latte off the menu, I think that drew in a lot of people here. But they said it cost too much to keep on the menu, unfortunately.

I still enjoy the chocolate cherry latte, it's not as sweet as it sounds. The pumpkin pie latte is also good, and I hear the chai hot chocolate is a treat too. The toasted marshmallow latte is quite sweet though, just to warn you. For a cold option, I like the coconut frap .. it's nice and light, not too sweet. You can switch between cold and hot for most of these options though.

I've always found their pastries to be delicious and never stale, unlike other coffee houses. The lemon swirl is to die for, if you like a strong lemon taste -- lots of flavour in every bite, with chunks of chewy lemon. Yum! The cinnamon swirl and chocolate croissants are also tasty. I was sad when they discontinued their key lime cookie, those were delicious! Unfortunately it wasn't popular enough so they took that off the menu too.

They don't have a bad collection either, and I'm impressed with the unique variety of import bottles. Roast is a nice venue too, with exposed beams and brick, and they frequently have live music.

There are so many really good places in this area where the management knows how to retain good people that one need not spend time in a place where the servers seem to change on a daily basis.

When I buy high-priced coffee, I like to have it in a real mug, not a cardboard cup that I could get at any fast-food joint. When the people here mistakenly put mine in a cardboard cup, I did not ask for a new coffee. Instead, I politely pointed it out in the hopes that they would get it right the next time. In return, I got an argument and nasty looks from the crew at the counter. Also, no matter now many people they have at the counter, they manage to keep even small groups of customers waiting on long lines.

Yesterday was the kicker. I asked for a decaf coffee and told there was no decaf. Even your average diner will usually ask a customer if he or she wants to wait while they brew up a pot of decaf. And this is a fancy café? I then asked if they had decaf espresso and was told that this too was all out.

Charming interiors, quite beautiful furniture, intriguing wall art, Edison-era light installations and what not.  They might have the best ambience any cafe in Edmonton has.  Perfect date place too, I think, with decent music playing and comfortable furniture for quiet conversations.

I've been here twice and agree with most reviewers in that they make interesting latte creations and teas.   I think they briefly had a caramel-bacon latte which sounds really interesting and I enjoyed their salted caramel latte.  They have a collection of craft beers and wines mainly from AB and the Okanagan region.  It's interesting and I'm glad they support local craft brews and wines, though at least on the beer front, these regions are not known for the best craft brews in Canada.

Why the 3 stars? Many might consider me a coffee snob when I say this, but I actually think that for $5, it's only fair that the quality of the actual espresso be far better than something you would get at a chain coffee shop.  This, however, they lack in.  The staff seem to know very little about actual coffee and how to make a good espresso and this disappoints me a little.  It's got a bit of a yuppie feel to it without delivering a quality product.  

I am not sure if I will go back because I know of places that make better coffee. There are many in Edmonton now (Elm, Transcend, Leva, Credo, Sugar Bowl, da Capo etc.) and to open up a new coffee shop and not strive to at least equal the bar set by these establishments, especially when they charge as much (some cases, more) as these other well established coffee joints, is a little disappointing for me.

They are however separated into two unique spaces.

Immediately we loved the ambiance and decor of the coffeehouse.  Spacious & Airy it felt very comfortable.  The staff behind the counter were uber friendly and helpful.  They alone deserve 5 stars each for outstanding customer service.  They were chatty and very accommodating with our kids which also impressed us.

We picked up a few items to try, the cookie topped doughnut, maple bacon cinnamon bun, cookies and a pain au chocolat.  Also indulged in some hot cocoa (kids), a cappuccino for me and hubs tried the salted caramel latte.  Everything was heavenly but the salted caramel latte was the big winner for me and well the maple bacon cinnamon bun for hubs (anything with bacon, right?).  They also had a Bacon Latte on the menu but were out of the candied bacon so we didn't get to try (this time).

The next day we stopped in on our way out of town.  The same friendly peeps were working behind the counter and remembered us.  We picked up some more goodies and coffee (this time I got the salted caramel latte - heaven) and left a very satisfied family indeed.

From the art installments, to the Halloween Parties and Ghost Tours to the building being empty for years.  When I was at the City Market downtown one weekend, I saw that they were restoring the building and it looked like maybe some new tenants.  I hoped that they were businesses and that they were not turning it into condos.

My prayers were answered and Roast Coffeehouse and Mercer Tavern were soon to be opened.

You would think that with my food obsession I would be one of the first people in on opening day...  Due to the busy summer I did not get to visit Roast until almost the end of August.  I had saw a tweet about a Maple Bacon Latte and knew I would have to drop in to see what they were all about.

The Bacon-Maple Latte is a maple flavoured latte. It is garnished with whipped cream and then a couple of pieces of caramelized Bacon.

The Bacon is fantastic! Crispy and gooey at the same time - it stuck to my teeth. Bacon lovers would love this taste experience.

If you want the latte to have any Bacon flavour in it you need to dunk one of your pieces of Bacon into the latte and let it float - that is, if you can resist eating it!

The Baristas at Roast took a while to get the latte out but it looked like they were having problems with one of the spouts on the espresso machine pulling shots. It was worth the wait - the shots were perfect.

The atmosphere and decor in Roast make for a very comfortable experience. The hardwood floors and open beamed ceiling are the originals from the warehouse. It has a rustic feel while the fireplaces give the atmosphere warmth and the stainless steel bar type chairs give it a touch of modern class. There are overstuffed leather chairs by the fireplaces so there are ""homey"" feels to certain areas as well. Sure to please many different types of customer.

The Good:
The space is lovely. It has great ambience and is roomy and stylish with plenty of comfortable seating. It's always cozy and warm, unlike many other cafes. There are nice little touches around, such as a self-serve dispenser with lemon water. This place doubles as a wine bar in the evenings and there's a  decent selection of wine and beer. The baked goods are also quite good. 

The Bad:
The service here is hit or miss. On some days, I have been greeted by a friendly face and on other days, I have had to deal with an unhelpful and lackadaisical hipster, whose description of the maple bacon latte was simply that it is ""sweet"". 

While they do have a small food menu, I have not had the chance to try anything as the one time I wanted to order something, I was informed that they were sold out of everything. This was at 4.p.m., which is the advertised time that they start serving food. 

The coffee here is ok. While they do have a selection of interesting and creative drinks (Maple Bacon latte, salted caramel latte etc.), the actual quality and taste of the espresso is on par with, or marginally above,  most chain coffee shops. For the prices listed, you would expect better quality. This is not to say that the drinks are bad -- only that they could, and should, be better.

761,2.0,"I had trouble placing the stars on this one because I actually love going to Roast, and enjoy it quite a bit. It is beautiful, tastes great, and is welcoming. BUT and this is a very big BUT for me. I understand that this business is new, and it's busy so I have given it some grace in that regard towards the issues I have concerns with but after happening to me on 7 different visits now I have to say I'm fairly dissapointed. 

Whomever is in charge of doing orders for Roast really needs to figure out how to order in abundance or order more than they normally do or whatever it may be. I have gone there on 7 different occasions to order different drinks each time and I am always told ""sorry we're out of this, or we're out of that"" Thus forcing me to order a drink I could get anywhere and was really less than thrilled about trying. Especially when it's a feature drink that you read on their FB page and decide yum! I'm going to go try it out and both times you visit during that special they are out of it. I once tried to get their Powered Chai literally 4 days in a row and they were out the entire time. Which was fine because I understood that they were new and the order had to come in and they gave me the option of trying their tea based chai. The time after that it was Pumpkin, the time after that it was the Apple Juice (out of Apple Juice?) 

I do love the atmosphere which is what keeps me going, and the drinks taste just fine, the desserts are delicious, and the service has been great, but the order issue is a serious bummer and definitely has me wanting to take the trip downtown for coffee meetings with clients less and less.

I know I'm a student, and I should be saving my money to pay off my loans, but caffeine is a necessity and sometimes the line at Tim Horton's on campus is so long that I decide to walk the two blocks down to Roast. And why not? It's so pretty inside, and the atmosphere is nice - not too casual and not too upscale to the point of being stuffy. The coffee is good. My favorite drink so far is probably the pumpkin latte, but I also enjoyed the maple bacon latte. Yes bacon and coffee together is a good thing. The food is pretty good too. They have a Thai sandwich from MRKT which was good, although I found their chocolate pastry a little dry. Prices are your typical nice coffee shop price - equal to being at a chain like Starbuck's - except Roast is a better coffeeshop.  Wifi is free and works well, except in the outdoor seating where I had a hard time picking up a signal. The staff are friendly too, and happy to make recommendations.

790,1.0,"First off if there was a lesser rating I could give it I would. Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly. So a group of us went in for Valentine's Day, we had a reservation for 8 and were sat by 845, no big deal we were just a bit cranky and hungry. The host was very nice and was trying her best. 
 We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes "" what did you have"" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with ""oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen"" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized. 
  I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes "" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food"" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here. I get that it was Valentine's Day and it was busy, completely understood but it's the mangers job to smooth over the situation. Comping the food is great but that doesn't fix anything.

It was not very busy so we were seated quickly but the hostess was not the greatest, basically just handing us some menus and walking away. No explanation of the menu or any specials or anything. Thankfully, our server was very nice and walked us through the menu since we had never been there. While there were a lot of options on the menu for lunch, the prices seemed to be what I would pay for dinner. It didn't seem like much of a lunch special to me. We got our drinks fast and some hot, fresh out of the oven bread that was so yummy, we quickly devoured the whole loaf. My husband got the create your own pasta with the garlic cream sauce with pene, shrimp, and mushrooms. We both agreed that the sauce was a bit of a let down. It was not very creamy or garlicy. Next time he's going to go with the alfredo. I had the meatball sliders with garlic Parmesan fries. The sliders were fantastic. The meatballs were so good, I could have been happy with just a plate of those, but putting them on the buttered buns made them even better, The order comes with three, which was the perfect amount, but the glutton in me wanted more. The fries were ok. They were very thin cut, but could have used a lot more garlic, they were pretty much just regular fries with a bit of cheese on top.

The level of incompetence at this place is extraordinary. 

The manager was very apologetic.  She was embarrassed at the level of service we received and made no excuses.  She of course comp our meal and offered to expedite the order so we could eat.

I vividly remember our first visit:  My husband ordered the Mama's Trio, I ordered Create your Own Pasta.   We were both pleasantly surprised; our meals were fantastic.  So fantastic, in fact, that we went back again the following week.  And then a few weeks later I invited my in-laws to join me for their first visit, to celebrate my birthday.  They left very very impressed.  Food and service were both excellent.  The lasagna left a memorable mark on me.  I raved to others that Macaroni Grill has the best lasagna I have ever tasted.

My husband and I continued to frequent the Reno Macaroni Grill.  We became fans on Facebook of the company and enjoy the updates.  We purchased several boxes of the Macaroni Grill lasagna at our local grocery store and frozen entrees to enjoy at home.

Salad to-go was room temperature, lettuce was soft and limp and not fresh and crispy. 

PARKING: outside parking shared with a big outside shopping area across from Petco and a Brewing Co. 

OUTSIDE: location itself is nice in a well developed shopping/restaurant area. Your typical look of a Macaroni Grill. Lots of outside seating on their wrap around patio. Refer to my photos. Nobody was sitting outside though, which was too bad since the weather was nice. I like how to the right of the front door there are nice benches and shade in case you need to wait for a table or for your to-go food. 

INSIDE: like all Macaroni Grills, darker ambiance, but setup and décor was the same. Bar on the left. Hostess counter straight ahead of you. Double door entrance as you come in with a second door to open. 

OVERALL: A-OK. Nice that they have to-go option and curbside to-go option. I was disappointed about the cannelloni, but even more disappointed about the salad.

The drink order got mixed up and it took over 20 minutes to get a draft beer (the place was not that busy). We ordered two appetizers and all our entrees, and when the appetizers came it was only one. Later the waitress came back and said they were out of the second appetizer. After about thirty minutes half of the dinner orders came out, and then the waitress told us they were out of one of the dinners we'd ordered. Another fifteen minutes later and still half of our party were missing their food, the waitress came back and told us they were out of yet another one of the entrees we ordered. 

The waitress said the manager was going to come and talk to us, but she never did and in fact, it looked like she was avoiding us. Finally, I got up and found the manager, told her about everything that had gone wrong and told her we were leaving. As we were putting on our jackets the manager finally came by and hastily apologized and said she'd checked with her ""sub-manager"" and they were comping the partial meal we'd gotten, which is hilarious because there's no way I was letting any us pay after all the screw ups on their end. 

Oh, and did I mention that the couple at the table next to our group seemed to be having the same kind of problems, but the manager managed to go over there and apologize and even sit with them for a bit.

He introduced himself as he wrote it and asked what he could get us to drink. He quickly brought a warm loaf of fresh bread for us to tear apart and dredge in their delicious garlic and olive oil.

David brought out mozzarella frittas by mistake, but when we told him that wasn't what we ordered, he quickly apologized and offered to replace it with the mozzarella caprese. The frittas looked so good, we decided to keep them. They were delicious, lightly breaded with a tasty arrabbiata sauce. When the frittas were gone, I dipped the remainder of the bread in the extra sauce. 

The spinach salad was topped with creamy, toasted goat cheese that really added to the flavor of the spinach. Try to get a small bit of cheese in every bite. Supposed to have prosciutto, but there wasn't any? We don't care to eat the garlic slices, so picked them out, but loved the flavor they left behind, which blended perfectly with the lemon juice.

I had the ""Chicken Portobello"" which was a huge portion that was plated over a very ample bed of ""orzo with spinach & vegetables"".  The flavors of this dish were quite impressive, not too salty as with most chain restaurants.  Only $13.99.....well worth the price due to the unlimited fresh baked bread that was delivered piping hot to our table.

Daughter had one of those Bowtie pasta dishes with chicken....it looked a lot like the dish she orders at the Cheesecake Factory.  She devoured every drop on the plate.

Wifey ordered the salmon ""low calorie"" plate, which consisted of baked salmon and fresh vegetables.  She seemed very pleased.

They are offering a special ""extra"" where you can get your choice of Appetizer and choice of dessert for only $5.99 extra. (a $13.50 value based on the individual prices of the crab-stuffed mushrooms and the smothered chocolate cake, which we all shared).

The total bill, including the tip, was under $55.  We were completely satisfied with both the food quality and service from Tyler, our young waiter.

As chain restaurants go, you could do a LOT worse than Romano's.

Due to the competition with the nearby BUFFETs at the casinos and hotels, THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION must try harder in order to lure the Reno tourists away from the cheap buffet deals that proliferate in Nevada.

They have two dining options - the first is with their traditional menu where you sit and a waiter takes care of you, the second is their express dining.  It's sort of a lunch line where they make the food fresh, but it's a limited menu and they do it for both lunch and dinner.  We went with the traditional dining and were seated promptly.  Our waiter was friendly and he kept the drinks and fresh bread coming.  The bread was delicious, piping hot with rosemary and they have olive oil and balsamic for dipping.

This turned out to  a huge disappointment on several levels -

We  went for lunch  the restaurant  was  basically  empty at 1:45 when we  arrived - 
the service  was  terrible - 
We were presented with the dinner menu  and when we asked for the lunch menu were told  this was all there was...

Once the  order was placed, the waiter parked himself  by the cooking line  & never came back, so we had to ask the bus boy for the Focaccia bread. The waiter then brought  everything  directly after the bread arrived, therefore we didn't have time to enjoy the bread, which  we  normally  devour as soon as it is put in front of us. Then had  to again wait for someone to come back so we could  ask  for balsamic vinegar to  add to the dipping olive oil.

My mom ordered:
Calamari Fritti crisp-fried, pepperoncini, arrabbiata 10
& house salad

The birthday girl ordered:
Bellini Cipriani - la marca prosecco, white peach purée 7

and we shared

Italian for Two @ $25.00

Tappas - Zucchini Fritti
 
Eggplant Quadratini
roasted eggplant, basil, tomato, ricotta salata, red chile 13.5

Chicken Milanese (add $3.00)
arugula Parmesan salad, roasted potatoes,  lemon butter

ok the -   Bellini  in a  tulip glass - lovely  but  $7.00??
The  Calamari was  a disappointment -  pale & - not  crispy  as  advertised-  the  house salad was  good.
Zucchini Fritti -  my daughter & I  each ordered one,  which for a change  was a mistake because one would have been enough for 3,  it was good but... not as good  as it looked on the menu or  I had hoped -  the "" ribbons"" were  not  long ribbons  instead they were small  pieces and a little greasy - should have  ordered only one of these and a different 2nd  tappas...
The Chicken Milanese was  pounded so thin  that it was  dried out &  had  no flavor -  the coating  was thicker than the chicken& the sauce  over top was  almost  non existent  - the arugula salad  had  absolutely no  taste what so ever,  the potatoes were plentiful, cooked  correctly &  had   loads of roasted garlic  which I did  love -

The eggplant quadratini was good going down, not so  much  later that evening when my daughter became ill and eventually  threw up after being miserable for several hours ... therefore she never touched the  leftovers...

The  ambiance we had always loved  in the  dining room  was  gone -  the music was no longer classic Italian music, the beautiful white gladiolas  were gone and  the happy birthday song which the waiters sing  in Italian never even happened - 
The hostess never looked up from the stand  to say goodbye -

Not just sitting in the window warmed ready to be taken the table, but cold out of the frig.

He then took my plate and must have placed it in he oven and yes it came back hot, but the bottom of the lasagne was burnt and stuck to the plate, I couldn't scrape it off to eat it. Not to mention that he price of $19 was way too much for the small portions without a salad. We were one of only four tables in the restaurant and not once did my tea get refilled. My husbands tea sat empty at the edge of the table for quite some time and was refilled as we were paying our bill. My husband had the chicken scallopini--the exact same item he has had for years and obviously the recipe has changed...for the worse. There was no sear in the chicken, it tasted boiled. The cheeses for the first time tasted like velveeta, not the original butter and cream recipe.  The kids each had spaghetti and meatballs and no thank you, we don't want to mix those leftovers to take home.

856,3.0,"We ate here once, I love macaroni grill for their fresh pasta, I was disappointed going, which was right around prom or homecoming so there was a ton of young kids there. The dinner was decent, nothing to write home about, and I ordered a house table red wine. The kid waiting our table was flustered which was understandable given that they were busy and we just so happen to decide to go on that one night. Oops, who knew? 

He brought me my wine in a HOT mug. Who on earth brings ANY wine in a mug, not to mention a Hot mug? Wine is served in a wine glass. Funniest thing about it was he drew on our table noting a wine glass and a tic mark. My boyfriend asked the waiter if he had a glass like he drew, and he obviously got upset and flustered saying they always serve house wine in a mug. 

I understand its traditional to serve it in a glass, in Italy, but if you know anything about wine, red optimal flavors are represented in 60-65F degrees, white a bit colder 50-55F degrees. If in the least they should give the option to customers of traditional customs or in a stem glass which they have, instead of serving in a hot glass ruining the flavor and raising the temperature to 80+F degrees.

Unfortunately our last trip was something else. As we entered we found a white board with the special of the evening listed. Only to be told they only had one more left. Then we went to the table and got the menus. My wife's favorite, veal Parmesan was no longer on the menu. She had to settle for something else. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs. Next we were informed they had no fresh bread and had to wait until they made some more. Then I was informed they were out of meatballs so I settled for meat sauce.

Sadly, though, after years of being a loyal customer I don't think I'll ever go back.  

I'm not sure if they changed from wonderful, amazing, delightful, delicious rosemary bread to dry, white, hamburger buns permanently, but the last time I was there that's what we were served.  Very dry, white bread buns that were barely edible.  I'm a bread person.  I'll choose a restaurant just for the bread.  Gah!  I'm so sad.

The server on our visit was barely available to us, took FOREVER to provide drink refills, never brought condiments we requested or refills for my two kids and wasn't ever at our table long enough for me to ask her what the deal was with the bread. 

They've also changed my favorite menu item that has been unchanged for many years, so that was just the straw that broke the camel's back.  I will not return.

We were a large group (11 people), and they were able to take our reservation relatively late in the day (just a few hours before dinner).  Always so convenient for a large party.  Even though Macaroni Grill is a chain, it's actually relatively nice - the open kitchen and stone decor on the interior make it seem much higher end.  

Unfortunately, the food was definitely below average.  My friend and I ordered the portobello mushroom chicken and the lobster ravioli and split the two dishes; it was probably the worst lobster ravioli I've ever had.  I'm not actually sure there was any lobster in my ravioli.  The portobello mushroom chicken was pretty decent, but the side (spinach orzo) was very blah.  We started the appetizer sampler which really is just a taste of a bunch of different appetizers (calamari, fried mozzarella, bruschetta, etc.).  We also ordered desserts which were huge - I'm not a dessert person, and I didn't even try a bite, but people seemed generally satisfied.

867,2.0,"Normally I like Macaroni Grill, but I don't know what in the hell has been up with them lately. Lack of concern? Lack of giving a crap about their patrons? Who knows. So I went there with my wife this past Monday night and our waitress was definitely not on point. Right out of the gate she asks us about our time constraints, and it was about 5:30 P.M. Now I can understand this logic if it were lunch time or earlier in the day, but that is literally the first time any waiter or waitress has ever asked me this at this time of the day. I hardly get asked this to begin with.

Not that it mattered, even if we were on a time constraint, we sure as hell weren't going anywhere fast, because ""prompt service"" was clearly not in her vocabulary. My wife ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and I got a Soda and Salad to start off with. I get my drink and Salad within 5 minutes... Still no wine for my wife. She's going around attending to some of the other folks, then mentions that ""the wine is on the way."" It's one glass of wine - what the hell? I didn't ask for a bottle of vintage wine from the Manager's personal stock at his house. 10 minutes later the wine gets there. My wife doesn't want to spoil the mood so I don't say anything, but I'm very visibly irritated and it's obvious at this point.

We had ordered around the time I got my salad, and come to find out now also, what my wife ordered she is just now finding out that they are ""out of"" for the night. Wonderful. So my food is almost ready at this point and my wife is having to re-order now. No offer to comp, no offer for complimentary dessert, nothing but pure apathy. Some of these waitresses and waiters wonder why people get crappy? Interesting.

We end up getting our food - I got the Chicken Marsala and my wife did a build your own spaghetti. My food went from pretty ""meh"" to kicking my ass afterward - it wasn't spicy at all yet it felt like fire coming out.

I won't go on and on beyond this because I don't have much else nice to say. I'm very disappointed with Macaroni Grill and their staff.

Everytime I visit my grandma, we try to go here, but I think yesterday was our last visit. (The previous time we visited, we walked out because our food took over an hour and my 4 year old was freaking out.)

My grandma had some coupons for their new ""$7 meal in 7 minutes or it's free"" so we each ordered two lunches at the counter. After about 15 minutes, we are still waiting for our food. All the employees keep looking at us nervously because they know it's been longer than 7 minutes. 

The lady who rang us up briefly says something to the head honcho chef looking man and then brings our food to us. I tell her she knows it's been twice the amount of time promised and that we want our food for free as advertised. Now, if it had only been a few minutes longer, I wouldn't have made a big deal. But it took TWICE as long. She immediately says, ""you only get it free if you are dining it. It doesn't count for to go orders."" No. I can tell right off the bat that's a load of crap so we ask to speak to the chef boss man. 

Here is a whole new problem. This man walks up to me and my 70 year old grandmother and says, ""Hi girls, what's going on?"" GIRLS? Really? What a patronizing prick. Don't you dare address my 70 year old grandmother as ""girl."" UGH. Anyways, he claims that corporate told them it doesn't count on carry out orders. I tell him to show me that on any one of their numerous advertisements. He can't because obviously he's lying. He just doesn't want to get dinged for being so slow. He says, ""Alright girls, I'll take care of it for you this time, but those are the rules."" Great, take care of it asshole.

The food is why only the 2 stars. I ordered  rustica and my husband ordered fettucine alfredo with shrimp. I have ordered the rustica on several of our visits it is one of my favorite dishes. But tonight it was dry and the shrimp were small compared to all the other times I have ordered it. They were dry and tough. Size wise they probably were something you could buy in a 60 count bag. I did ask for extra sauce and Jayme was more than happy to get it for me. However, the sauce had a lot of black pepper in it which made it spicy/hot and not very enjoyable. A few pieces of the chicken were fatty. Just not a pleasant experience.  My husband said his alfredo was bland and needed some help. His shrimp was also the same size that were in my dish  and it didn't have very many in his dish. The bread was awesome. Hot and fresh. 

I probably will go back because this is the first ""bad"" experience we have had with the food here.

So  just right after the holidays , we decided to try their dinner, the service personnel were equally pleasant and friendly.  The food were served quick and as tasty as I remembered.

912,4.0,"Fun story.  Last week Macaroni Grill was running a special for 2 for one express lunches.  Normal cost is $7.00, but with the deal order one entree, get the second one for free.
I work in a large office.  A number of people at the office decided this would be a great day to order lunch at Macaroni Grill and take advantage of the 2 for 1 price.  12-16 people placed orders online.  If you are in the restaurant the express lunch is $7.00 ready in 7 minutes or the order is free.  This is not true of the online ordering.  We were fine with this.  We were told by the online order the time our last order would be ready was about 20 minutes.  We arrived in 25 minutes in hopes our orders would be ready.  Long story short, they were not ready and we ended being at the restaurant 35 minutes waiting.  Lots of the food was cold, some people didn't get what they ordered and overall the initial experience was not good.  I called and asked to speak to the manager on duty.  It was Troy but he was behind the counter cooking to help get orders out.  This I could be believe because the restaurant was really really busy.
I left my name and number and asked for him to call me back.  After the lunch rush he called me back.  He was extremely sincere and apologetic.  He asked where we worked and offered to make things right.  He gave us two choices.  He would provide a family style meal or we could do a ""do over"".  I choice the ""do over"" since the whole office didn't order didn't think it would be fair to bring in a family style meal and not share with everyone. Troy give me the direct number to him and told me when he would be in the restaurant.  

Today was ""Do Over"" day.  I called about 45 minutes before we wanted to pick up the order.
Troy remembered speaking to me ( it was 6 days ago), he asked for the orders no questions asked.  I gave him a list of orders and included each person's name. He asked when I wanted to pick up the order.  I said 11:30.  One of the items we ordered were cookies.  He explained they don't always have cookies but he would see what he could do for us. We got to the restaurant and could see things were much calmer.  Our order was being put together and we were asked to have a seat for a few minutes.  At most we waited 5 minutes and we were handed three bags of food, extra dressings, cheese and utensils.  I asked the two people who presented our food to thank Troy for us.  As we were walking out, he called to us and asked us to wait a minute.  He came up to us with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies still hot and gooey.  You could tell they had just come out of the oven. I thanked him again for making this right and going above and beyond.

Thank you again Troy for turning this around.  We will definitely be back.

By the time my new plate came out, he was already finished eating.  So, we each ate alone even though we were at the same table, they offered nothing to him while he waited for me to eat, and not one bit of the check was reduced.

1.  The cheese raviolis with pesto sauce and grilled mushrooms, basil and broccoli.  YUM!
2.  All the food is pretty good here, and I like that the meat-free options have lots of add on veggie options

917,4.0,"April 2, 2011 Saturday - Dinner 5:45 PM
2 people (1 kid and me)

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 4 stars
Service - 3 stars

Background - Been here many times in the past but do not remember how long it has been since the last visit, more than a year easily.

Atmosphere - Dimly lit restaurant chain with a rustic ""Italian"" feel.  The restaurant was full and half of the customers were prom goers.  While waiting to be seated I just my daughter the cart of logs being hauled in, which led to the conversation about the wood oven they have in the corner of the kitchen.

Food
Appetizer - The free bread they provide before the meal was piping hot, the steamed poured out after pulling it apart with my hands.  The second loft served during the meal was the same way.

Dinner - I had order the Roasted Chicken Cannelloni.  The cheese filling was excellent.  The sauce was not too sweet, just right, but there could have been more.  I would have loved to dip my bread into the sauce.  The chicken had little to no flavor; it could have been very firm tofu.  I would have preferred that the cannelloni be served on a plate instead of a flat wide bowl; it just made the use of a fork a little challenging, as the bowl served no purpose to hold anything in.

Dessert - We skipped this as I had planned on another location for this treat.

Service - The hostess indicated that was a small wait as they were cleaning and prepping the table, not an issue as I was expecting a wait.  A minute later she indicated that she was ready.  While walking to the table half way there we had to turn around as the table was not ready.  When we did get there the table was set up for four people, strange.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  My daughter received an adult sized beverage, I figured she was getting older, so I was comfortable and did not send it back even though she order from the kids menu.  So the bill arrived and her drink was on the tab, as it should not be as it is part of the kid's meal.  They charge $2.20 for a glass of Sprite, really?  I brought this up to the waitress, she looked at the bill and then the class quickly, and instantly she knew what happened.

We ordered the Shrimp Portofino - Angel Hair Pasta with Sauteed Shrimp, Mushrooms, Pine Nuts, and Spinach with a Citrus Butter Sauce and the Pasta Milano- Juicy Grilled Chicken with Mushrooms, Sun-Dried Tomatoes in a Garlic Cream Sauce with Bow Tie Pasta. 

The Shrimp Portofino could have been a larger portion seemed a bit small but was very delicious. The right out of the oven fresh baked bread dipped in Olive Oil & Balsamic was to die for.

When asked for drinks I asked for a couple of samples of wine and he looked a bit irritated since I wanted to know what bottle I wanted to get for dinner. After he brought the samples with attitude I decided to get a beer. When our food arrived we were offered nothing with our meals and only brought 2 set ups when there was 4 of us. Mid meal one of us asked for cheese and alfredo brought it with a little bit of anger. I would understand if it was busy that he was frustrated and slammed but it was a slow night.

I had the honey grilled salmon with rice - it was amazing REALLY amazing! The fish was PERFECT.. 

Our server kept our glasses full - love Cate!!! She even wrote her name down on the paper table cloth so we would know her name. 

My friend had the chicken Parmesan - it was SO good, he couldnt stop saying ""ummm this is SO good"" which takes a lot to get him all excited about his food - I really thought he was gonna go make love to the chef! 

We shared a slice of New York cheese cake at this point my gut was about to bust but I managed to scarf down a bite or two - WOW it was yummy too!

Otherwise, you may find yourself disappointed. Notice I didn't say that you WILL find yourself disappointed, it's not sure thing. Which is why, for now, I can only give MG 3 stars. I've given this restaurant more chances than I really should have. And consistency is really the only factor that is just not quite where i'd like it to be. 

Some days the meal is delicious. Some days my entree was somehow never placed with the rest of my table's order. Some days my meal is a disaster. 

As far as chain restaurants go, I'd still pick MG over almost anything else. 

And really, for a server to have to learn how to spell his/her name upside down and in crayon at every table without screwing up? That deserves some props.

959,4.0,"Generally speaking, my experience at Macaroni Grill has rarely been a disappointment however this time it was all about recovery and genuine great service which prompted this review and hats off to our server (Lura) who did an amazing job!

To elaborate a bit on what I mean with my introduction, it started when I ordered the pollo caprese. According to the menu, this dish is grilled chicken breast, imported buffalo mozzarella, imported pomodorina, capellini but I've been on carb restricted diet so I opted out the capellini pasta and subbed the sautéed spinach. So what arrived from the kitchen was a grilled, tough and dry chicken breast, uncooked (basically raw) spinach and a few clumps of mozzarella (which had a unusual taste I find hard to describe, but not as it should). There was no imported pomodorina nor did the dish look at all appetizing!

I thought to myself after the runner left it on the table that I would never order this dish again even before I tasted it, so when our server Lura stopped shortly there after to check on the meal she could see immediately that I was not pleased and glanced at my plate and understood why. She politely asked me if she could make the matter right and took my plate back to the kitchen.

She returned a short while later with my dinner and brought the pomodorina which really helped the dish and a complete new order of the spinach (but again - was not really any better than the first version I was served). 

My recommendation is with all the other menu options to choose from at Macaroni Grill, keep clear of this particular dish, but do ask for Lura because she is a delight and really tried her best to make this so-so meal a more pleasurable experience!",9OG5YkX1g2GReZM0AskizA,Romano's Macaroni Grill,Reno,2.5,-119.7893392,39.4761165,"Restaurants, Italian","{'Monday': '11:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '10:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-20:0', 'Friday': '11:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-21:0'}",5505 S Virginia St,NV

2nd time out here in Reno, extremely hungry, only thing that sounded appetizing at the time was pasta. Contacted my friend who is a local. He recommended Macaroni Grille and a few others but macaroni grille was the closest and said F it. So I made the 5 minute drive from the Peppermill. It was around 9 pm when I arrived. Parking was accessible. Got inside, unfortunately was not greeted promptly. After asking a bartender if it was open sitting or if someone would seat us she helped us right away and sat us. No biggie. Inside was clean. Host sat us down next to the fire place where we would be warm! Very nice. Our waiter, by the name of Robert, introduced himself and instantly offered us a wine. We had the sausage rigatoni and spaghetti with meatballs. I ordered the sausage rigatoni spicy. Robert offered to bring out a few things to spice up our dish- nice touch! While waiting for our food we were brought the free bread with oil. To be honest, wasn't a big fan of the bread but no big deal! We didn't come here for the bread. While waiting for our pasta we had Sauvignon Blanc. As someone who does not drink wine, the Sauvignon black was the niceyest that I've ever had, (again, I don't drink wine). Our pasta arrived and Robert brought us Parmesan cheese and red pepper flake. To wrap it up, Robert was great because of his personal recommendations and his professionalism as a server, he made the experience really great, he's the man.

My wife decided to bring me here for Father's Day. It was a good choice, I really enjoyed it. It is been over 10 years since I've been here. Couldn't really remember why we didn't return, 

The service was great, the manager sat us and was very friendly. For Father's Day, it was not that busy. However the server did tell us that it was really busy earlier, before we arrived, and they are shortstaffed. We saw none of this.

What we ordered:

Drinks
Top shelf margarita, on the rocks, no salt.
Peach sangria
Lemonade for kids

Dinner
Father's Day menu
Steak & potatoes, medium rare, 
Garden salad
Shrimp Portofino
Kids meatballs with spaghetti
Kids chicken with broccoli

Dessert
Decadent Chocolate cake

The garden salad is a $2.50 ad on, however if it is unlimited refills. It arrived and was very tasty, made with bib/butter leaf lettuce. It was missing tomatoes. I asked her for another salad as it is unlimited, but I asked her to add tomatoes. She came back and said it was a very busy day and there was no tomatoes. So she took it off the bill. The dinner also came with a small loaf of bread, that was tasty. It was topped with fresh butter and Parmesan. A little on the salty side.

The steak was cooked perfectly. It was also very tender. Probably one of the best steaks I've had in the restaurant the last few years. The potatoes were baby red potatoes, roasted with a Parmesan cheese. It was powdered cheese, kind a like the Parmesan shaker you get a pizza joint. They had a nice caramelization, tender, yet a little crunch. Can't ask for better. The broccoli that came with it, had a nice rich flavor, but was a little too al dente for me. I think that's just a matter of preference though. 

My wife's shrimp was also cooked perfectly, it came with angel hair pasta and mushrooms. The flavor was a little bland. I think it was a garlic butter, but just not enough flavor for me. But she didn't complain lol. She did like the pinenuts in it and the green leaf vegetable in it.

The kids dishes had good flavor. I think the chicken was about 2 ounces, as well as two small meatballs for the kids meals at six dollars. Lots of pasta in it and marinara sauce. I do feel the kids were a little bit short changed. Not very much protein at all, tons of pasta for six dollars. I was able to share my steak with them so they were happy.

977,1.0,"This used to be my favorite restaurant for Italian food. Unfortunately though, over the past few years, the price has gone up and the food quality and service has gone down. Way down. 

The last two times I've been there the waiters have been absolutely terrible. The first guy was on speed or something and made it obvious that he was annoyed when we asked for bread and other simple requests. During this same trip we waited there for over an hour for two simple salads. 

During our next visit, it was clear that the waiter was hung over. In fact I think he may have been still drunk from the night before. He even knocked over a couple of glasses at different tables. He would constantly repeat his introduction even though he had already been by to take our order. Finally after 30 minutes our salads and soup came. The soup was ok, but the salad was old and the croutons were so disgusting that my girl friend spit them out. They were beyond stale. Our eggplant Parmesan took over 1 hour and 45 minutes to make. We literally were getting up to walk out when it arrived. To make matters worse, the red sauce was so cold that parts of it were still frozen. The eggplant was disgusting as well, we needed a steak knife to cut it. Then the manager came by as she could tell we weren't happy. Her attitude from the very beginning was very defensive. We explained our frustration with the salad, wait time, staff, and entree. She immediately tried to justify the wait time by saying eggplant takes at least an hour to cook. She then claimed that the croutons were made about an hour ago - clearly a bunch of BS. She concluded with ""I'm not supposed to tell you this but our eggplant is very earthy"". Whatever that means. I've had eggplant at other fine restaurants and it never takes longer than 30 minutes to cook nor does it take much effort to cut.

979,5.0,"Been here a few times now. Every single experience has been wonderful!

The food and service has been exceptional each time. This last visit we enjoyed live Italian style opera singing. It was very unexpected and fun, definitely not something you typically see at a restaurant chain. 

Every time we've come we couldn't leave less than a 20% tip, these waiters and waitresses are not just nice they are truly genuine. They aren't over the top, with a cheesy ""hello and how may I help you's"" only to scurry from the table as quickly as possible. They genuinely smile and make conversation, have impeccable timing and attentiveness even on a busy Friday night, and know how to make recommendations from the menu. Really wish we could note all their names individually to give them props. 

The food is fully flavorful, not just salty. The bread is warm a loaded with rosemary flavor, I always request balsamic with my dipping Olive oil. Each dish has a unique flavor profile not just your typical Italian style chain where the only options are salty cheesy or salty tomato. People have complained about portion size/cost ratio on other reviews but honestly, I have never left here anything less than STUFFED with left overs for lunch the next day. We typically spend $55-$60 on two specialty drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees (my choice usually being a seafood/lobster dish) at dinner, not shabby at all when you consider the customer service, atmosphere, quality, AND quantity at that price. 

If you suffered a bad experience here, I am strongly advising you give it a second/third shot and even mention your last experience to your waiter when you come in, I'm positive a place like this will make it up to you. This is probably my favorite restaurant of the moment. Totally worth the five star review I'm giving it.",9OG5YkX1g2GReZM0AskizA,Romano's Macaroni Grill,Reno,2.5,-119.7893392,39.4761165,"Restaurants, Italian","{'Monday': '11:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '10:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-20:0', 'Friday': '11:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-21:0'}",5505 S Virginia St,NV

Last Sunday I decided to order the dish pictured (the mushroom ravioli) via Doordash. Ordering went fin, but when it arrived, it seemed a little light for a dish that might resemble the dish featured on their menu, especially one costing $21. I opened it up and I saw this monstrosity. Only a few pieces of ravioli, burnt to the point of being inedible with a dash of (also burnt) mushroom gravy. I immediately called up the restaurant and demanded an explanation. I was told that the General Manager cooked this particular dish and that I would be getting a refund in a week. 
Well, it's been a week. I called and was told it might be another couple of weeks before I get my refund because the folks in the corporate office are only occasionally in the main office anymore. I did get an offer for them to remake my order. No thanks. Fool me once . . .

1001,4.0,"I almost let the bad reviews keep me away from this place, but I had a craving for mushroom ravioli and decided to try it anyway. Most of these bad reviews revolve around poor service, and I was feeling exceptionally patient yesterday so my husband and I gave it a go. 
When we arrived (Wednesday night 8:45 p.m.) it was very slow, I counted two other tables inside the restaurant when we entered but several people dining at the bar area. 
The guy who sat us (Zack) was also our server, so we were able to order drinks right away. This place makes a fantastic Shirley temple. I'm normally not a soda drinker and I finished my glass. 
Zach was courteous and competent. He brought us bread and even came back by with balsamic vinegar per our request. We ordered the mac and cheese bites appetizer with truffle sauce. So delicious (you can't go wrong with fried macaroni and cheese!) We also ordered mushroom ravioli. This has always been my favorite dish from Romanos, and it did not disappoint. In fact my husband mentioned he thought they added more mushrooms than usual and we love mushrooms. 
Our entrees came with Caesar salad. This is new or newer, in the past you always had to add a salad if you wanted salad with your entree. We were surprised when it came to the table since we had not ordered them, but Zack let us know they come with our entree. I'm not a huge fan of Caesar dressing but this salad was so delicious, the lettuce was crisp and cold, the dressing was creamy and it had the perfect amount of Parmesan cheese on top. We really enjoyed our meal here. Zack came by to check on us, offereing us dessert before bringing the check.

Ate here today ordered pasta salad and an appetizer. Our waitress was amazing her name is Katie she is very attentive kind and helpful.

Ordered pasta to go with Italian sausage the cook forgot the sausage then we asked for it to be added and the cook added the sausage on cold almost a frozen cold we complained and the manager was extremely rude explained they're busy. Busy and slow is one thing throwing cold sausages on a warm to go dish is unforgivable.

Manager needs to go she can't manage and has a very bad attitude. People behind us were complaining because of slow service etc.


The vibe in the place from workers was no one wanted to work there we watched the cook grab her stuff and run out.

Avoid this place not worth it!

The manager comped our entire meal and still I don't feel that was even good enough it was such a disappointment in so many ways.

Katie is the best thing at that place and I hooe they appreciate her!

My spaghetti was oily and had basically no meat sauce and the meatballs just tasted like oregano and nothing else. It was disgusting and inedible. My husband's pasta was flavorless. You could not taste garlic, cream, mushrooms or tomatoes. Again all you could taste was oregano! The pasta was very al dente and overall it was just Bland and disappointing. The broccolini were raw and had no seasoning on them whatsoever not even salt or butter or anyting! The only thing I actually liked was the bruschetta which I added a balsamic glaze to.

Our service was exceptional, but the food was forgettable and overpriced. I ordered the spaghetti and house-made meatballs and the better half got some rigatoni dish with a cream sauce and chicken.

The spicy meatball appetizer arrived about 5 minutes after ordering and was in a bowl with some bland meatballs hiding under crushed tomatoes.  It was not spicy by any standard.  The entrees arrived 5 minutes after the appetizer.  The penne rustica was ok but the prosciutto was without flavor besides a little saltiness, a gray color like anchovies, and dry and chewy like beef jerky.  My wife gave her mama's trio a 5 of 10 with the chicken the best of the 3 choices.

The waitress visited 4 times: at the beginning to take the appetizer order, to take the entree and drink order, to ask about boxes at the end, and to leave the card receipt.

Why did you charge me for it? Why was there no explanation that it was not included? And why did I have to call back and ask what happened? Then my wife's vegetables were not included and she was given a caesar salad instead, which she can't eat because she is lactose intolerant. And then my build your own pasta did not have the bolognese sauce it was supposed to have nor any sauce for that matter. The explanation when I called back was that I could drive back 15 minutes to the restaurant to get sauce if I wanted. No thanks! I won't be back!

After I read my order, she asked if there'd be anything else, I said it would be all, then she hung up on me. Hmm.. weird, I thought. So I go in to pick up my order, which (my fault) I didn't double check, and come home to find multiple items missing. I call back to make sure I wasn't charged, since I didn't receive an itemized receipt, and the same lady answers. ""Okay well I didn't hear you,"" she says after I explained the situation, and hangs up on me...AGAIN. Thankfully I wasn't charged. So, I figure, she had a bad night, whatever. 

So then last night, I decide to order takeout again. I recognize the woman's voice immediately, so I go ahead and place my order, once again she gives me the total, I say okay, she hangs up on me without reading back the order or telling me how long it'll be. So I call back asking how long it'll be, ""I don't know, 20 minutes?"" HANGS UP. At this point I'm wondering if I even go pick up the food, but I think to myself whatever, the Mac is good. So I go down to pick up my food, and a woman brings it out to me. Low and behold, it's the same woman that on the phone, AND she's the manager!

1042,1.0,"We booked our company Christmas party here last Saturday, December 8th. Huge mistake. Our party was for 20 people. They had our table set up in a separate room with another group which was fine, plenty of room. The first mistake they made was allowing us to order direct from the menu. In our past experience at other restaurants, we have been given a limited menu which allows the kitchen a better opportunity to get everyone's food out in a timely manner. When we arrived our table was set up but had no menus on the table and no waters. Our waiter came over to take drink orders and everything seemed like it might start to be normal. He left with our drink orders and drinks slowly made their way to our table, still no waters or menus. Everyone immediately ordered a second drink because the first drink took so long. Finally, menus arrived...still no water and no one asked if we wanted water. I noticed that our waiter was basically by himself to handle our entire table. Again, at other restaurants, we are used to having 2 or 3 servers handle our large group. We ordered appetizers, again they slowly made their way to the table. We ordered our main courses. Entrees started to make their way to the table and it quickly became apparent that only half the table received their main course. The waiter came over and stated he messed up and lost half our orders, he took the orders a second time for those of us that did not receive any food. Again, these orders slowly made their way to the table and they were still missing 5 people. We sat down at 6pm it is now 8pm, two hours in a 5 people didn't have their food. The waiter and manager came over this time to ask once again what we were missing. 3 of the 5 ordered again, myself and one other guest decided not to re-order. I have worked in the food & beverage industry and have had many group gatherings at restaurants over the years and I have to say that Macaroni Grill was the least prepared to handle a group I have ever seen. When companies like ours plan these parties it is usually once a year and it is an important event to show our appreciation to our employees, to have it go so painfully wrong is not only upsetting but unacceptable for a restaurant like Macaroni Grill. One server assigned to our table, no menus on the table, no waters on the table, our guests having to go to the bar to get their own water and drinks, missing food orders, 2 hours into the party and guests still without food. This says to me very clearly that Macaroni Grill is improperly managed and they do not have a clue as to how to handle a group party. The manager ultimately took 25% off the bill and the waiter removed a couple of wines and coffee, none of which made the evening any less intolerable. As poorly as our group was handled they should be embarrassed that they charged us at all.",9OG5YkX1g2GReZM0AskizA,Romano's Macaroni Grill,Reno,2.5,-119.7893392,39.4761165,"Restaurants, Italian","{'Monday': '11:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '10:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-20:0', 'Friday': '11:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-21:0'}",5505 S Virginia St,NV

We finally got out bread about 5 minutes after that. We ordered Fettuccine Alfredo with Shrimp and Buffalo Chicken Parmesan. It took quite some time to get our food. It wasn't busy or anything either. The food was okay. Definitely not a $20 plate, you can get similar options at Olive Garden that taste better and cost less. When we were done we gave the server our form of payment and she took and came back with it 10 minutes later. Which is a long time when someone has something as sensitive as a card.

We waited a few minutes to be seated , that was ok . The hostess seated us , presented the menus mentioned some specials , all fine and normal . After a awhile a waiter showed up , not sure if it was his first night or he just sucked as a waiter . He fumbled through trying to sell us wine then needed to collect the glasses on the table and take them away all before taking our drink order . Later he came back took our drink and food order .

Last Sunday I decided to order the dish pictured (the mushroom ravioli) via Doordash. Ordering went fin, but when it arrived, it seemed a little light for a dish that might resemble the dish featured on their menu, especially one costing $21. I opened it up and I saw this monstrosity. Only a few pieces of ravioli, burnt to the point of being inedible with a dash of (also burnt) mushroom gravy. I immediately called up the restaurant and demanded an explanation. I was told that the General Manager cooked this particular dish and that I would be getting a refund in a week. 
Well, it's been a week. I called and was told it might be another couple of weeks before I get my refund because the folks in the corporate office are only occasionally in the main office anymore. I did get an offer for them to remake my order. No thanks. Fool me once . . . 
I will never be eating here again and I don't recommend anyone else do until they either hire new management or, at least, banish the GM from the kitchen. They clearly don't know how to cook or about appropriate portions

Update: even though they told me to contact them on their website, I did and have yet to get any sort of response whatsoever. I even called the restaurant again. No call back.

Virginia, we saw Macaroni Grill was open for business.  No wait and the restaurant was about 50% full.  Scored a table and ordered fried calamari, pizza, chicken marsala and several pastas.  Food was great but we did not receive the calamari appetizer.  Our waiter heard us mention this to another server and he jumped into action!  He found out another table was delivered the appetizer and they ate it!  By then, we were not as interested in the appetizer.  Our waiter took the appetizer off of our bill and then scored us two free desserts.  It was a cool gesture and really ended our dinner on an up note.

1080,2.0,"Me and my girlfriend came here for a romantic dinner and it was an okay experience.

Firstly, the server forgot to bring the soups out. I only got to ask where the soups were after she had placed the entrees down. She had mentioned to us that she was serving many tables. Maybe our server was in a bad mood or she was being overworked. However, my seating area was near the kitchen and I watched as servers either stood around or complained to each other. I got the vibe that no one working there wanted to be there or be bothered to give a good eating experience. 

Another example of the service was when I had asked the server if she could put my gift card code into the check. She said she would ask. After desert, when the check was given, she completely forgot to ask about the gift card. The matter was resolved but it does make me question if anyone working is paying attention. 

For the food, it was pretty tasty. The bread was good and I appreciated the olive oil and balsamic vinegar mix. For an appetizer, we ordered the caprese salad which was the nice ratio of tomato to mozzarella. For my entrée I ordered the Cafe Milano which was also yummy. The ingredients such as the mushrooms tasted fresh and the chicken was well seasoned. The tiramisu was really good  and I'd come back here only to eat that. 

I want to mention that you are paying for the ambience of the establishment. The food is marked up by a lot which I would not mind if it weren't for the sub par service and atmosphere as mentioned earlier.

I frequented it more in my pre-Yelp days, mainly because I once had a credit card that would give me points and I would trade all of my points in on restaurant gift cards.  Conveniently located on South McCarran and South Virginia, there is plenty of parking.

My ""go to"" dish is Shrimp Portofino: sautéed jumbo shrimp, capellini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, pine nuts, lemon butter  It is actually quite good and the bread that they serve is really good.  The service here is great - people are very friendly and they will keep loaves and loaves of bread coming if you ask.

I usually eat during the ""off hours"".  I eat dinner pretty early if it's going to be a large meal, so I have encountered the restaurant when there were a few patrons, but not when it was overly crowded.

Tip:  Regarding the Steak & Greens salad: 5 oz. sliced sirloin, baby kale, spinach, radicchio, arugula, crispy prosciutto, gorgonzola, crispy onions, balsamic herb dressing.  The balsamic herb dressing can be overbearing, I usually order it on the side.

We had a reservation at 7 for ten people and we were not sat until 7:30. They didn't seem super busy but I have worked in the industry before and I know that sometimes parties take longer than usual and things come up. Not a huge problem. HOWEVER, when we were seated we got our menus ordered a bottle of wine (that came out very promptly, thank goodness) and two appetizers: bruschetta and artichoke dip. We didn't get our appetizers until 8:19pm. After waiting forty minutes for our appetizers we were finally able to order our entrees which also took forever. I don't remember when we ended up leaving but it was way too late and after 9:15pm and several of us were not satisfied with our meals and didn't even eat them but at that point we just wanted to get out of the restaurant and never return. 
Throughout our meal there was a lot of apologizing and blaming the kitchen and the chefs but with all of that blame I was surprised that a manager didn't come check to see if everyone was okay. That wouldn't have helped the experience because I won't go back but usually if there is that much wrong with the kitchen someone will come out and apologize or comp an appetizer or SOMETHING.

Wine...
I had a glass of the house red and it was not very good, there are many inexpensive wines that taste decent but this was definitely not it. I ordered the Italian Chianti for my second glass.  

Food...
Ordered the Pollo Caprice and was disappointed. First it was salty, the mozzarella was salty, the arugula salad (was very very small portion, about 1/4) was salty & the grilled chicken breast was not only salty but rubbery, it was obviously cooked from frozen and had fake grill marks. Definitely not worth $17, go through any drive through for a better piece of chicken for 25% the price!

Service...
Was quick and friendly, I only have positive comments for the service. 

My wife and I use to love Macaroni Grill and I wondered why I've seen so many locations shutting down, I was in Reno and saw this location was open and decided to stop in for a nice meal but was disappointed and feel like I was ripped-off in the process, so now I understand why there're going out of business, and why I'll no longer be a patron.

Moreover, the Caesar Salad was suppose to come with crotons and there was no crotons - a small thing, but the salad I got was a pile of lettuce with a weird tasting - super thick cream sauce, it was rather off-putting.

Little Italy
Worth the Money

I shall now make a list of things that the Macaroni Grill is:
A good place to wait too long to be seated
A place with friendly wait staff once seated
A place that offers good food albeit overpriced 
Boring and a prime example of what happens when a restaurant stops trying

We went to the Macaroni Grill about two weeks ago for lunch.  I hadn't been there for the better part of a decade.  The place was vacant.  Maybe 4 other tables were full.  We stood at the podium for a good three for four minutes before we were even greeted.  

Once greeted we were sat quickly and orders were taken.  The food was very good (especially the deep fried macaroni balls and the fry appetizer).  Drinks were never empty and our waiter never let us get to low on bread.  

They really are way too expensive now for what they are and that's the deal breaker.  When the Macaroni Grill first opened they offered something that Reno didn't have.  Reno has grown and new restaurants have far surpassed this chain.  They really need to either lower prices or close up shop.

I won't go back.  It was my last visit.  If I'm craving expensive Italian, I will go to a multitude of places that now call Reno home.

1103,1.0,"What happened?  

It's been at least 5 years since I've eaten here, and while it was never my favorite it was decent to occasionally very good.  I only went back because it was a lunch date with my little sister and she picked it out (even though I suggested other places, she likes ""italian"" food and wanted to try this)

I realize everyone is cutting back these days, so I wasn't surprised to see they no longer had fresh cut flowers but other than that the interior was as I remembered it.  Still cozy and lovely with the dim lighting and spacious seating.  

The menu looked different from what I remembered, and they were featuring a promotional tapas for 2 menu.  1 tapa (appetizer) and 1 entree pp.  These were generally the cheaper menu items, but still a savings of $2-$6 pp if you were to order an app and entree each.  I think there was a selection of about 6 different items on each section.  They were out of the only entree that appealed to me and would not make a comparable substitution.  I wanted the chicken and mushroom cannelloni but ended up with a grilled chicken breast with angel hair pasta caprese.  My sister chose a creamy rigatoni dish with chicken.  We shared the goat cheese stuffed peppers and the zucchini fritto.  

The portions were large but the food was disgusting.  The zucchini fritto was paperthin slices of zucchini breaded and fried.  There were burned bits and other bits that were doughy and clumped together.  It lacked flavor and was greasy.  The peppers were interesting, tangy pickled peppers stuffed with cream cheese and heated then topped with fried bread crumbs and balsamic glaze drizzle.  I think they would have been much better served cold.  My sisters pasta was a giant bowl of rigatoni in a watery sauce and slices of chicken breast that look like the type of pressed chicken you get in school lunches.  Even with a lot of added parmesean cheese it was very bland.  My dish was a tough black charred chicken breast (again, tasted like formed chicken)  a glob of solidified angel hair pasta with a few cubes of mozzerella all melted together with wilted basil (I'm guessing my dish sat under a heater for a while).  The arugula salad it was served with was mostly spinach, again wilted with a dab of garlicky pesto.  I had literally two bites of food before I pushed my plate away. The chicken was dry and tough and tasted of salt and char, the pasta tasted of salt and old tomatoes.  I did enjoy the warm bread.  

Aside from terrible food, my final gripe is a petty one.  My sister ordered a peach lemonade and I ordered an ""italian soda"" which was soda water plus the same peach syrup in my sister's lemonade.  These beverages were listed together on the menu (no price listed so I assumed they were overpriced).  They were $3 each, but what annoyed me was that I asked for a refill and was told the soda did not have refills, but the lemonade did.  My soda came in a tall narrow glass packed with ice and could not have held more than 4 oz of liquid in all.  My sister's lemonade was a 20oz glass with about 1/4 full of ice.  I could understand if they opened a fresh bottle of pellegrino per soda, but this was just soda water from a soda gun so I don't see why it would cost more for refills?  Or why it wasn't listed separate from the free refill drinks like tea and lemonade?",9OG5YkX1g2GReZM0AskizA,Romano's Macaroni Grill,Reno,2.5,-119.7893392,39.4761165,"Restaurants, Italian","{'Monday': '11:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '10:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-20:0', 'Friday': '11:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-21:0'}",5505 S Virginia St,NV
1104,4.0,"I'm not a big fan on chain restaurants but I have to say their 5 for $25 is an amazing deal. It really should be called $25 for 2 fat guys or 5 teen age girls for $25 .. Although the later is probably not appropriate for obvious reasons.

Two small loaves of bread, a heaping serving of Caesar (which was actually invented in Tijuana, but that's another story) and a big thing of pasta.. For $25? How can you go wrong?

My location in Reno uses Doordash and was here in less than 40 min.

1110,4.0,"This place is on a level with Olive Garden or eastern TGIFridays in terms of menu, atmosphere, and quality. The prices are even in line with what you should expect from the Fridays/O.G. Big difference is here they give you crayons so you can doodle on the table while you wait on the next round. I don't doodle. I take colouring very seriously. Don't seat me without a minimum of five colours. Joking of course; I bring my own.

The wait staff is friendly and very efficient. They should crayon their name upside down on your butcher paper. If not, ask them to. It's different and fun.

The wine selection appears to be pretty decent, but I'm not really a wine guy. They see me coming and immediately pull the alcohol glasses from the table. They have a killer ice tea, however!

One disadvantage of aging is limited income. It makes dining out a challenge. The Macaroni Grill folks send us email coupons twice a week. Many times a BOGO. It's a great way to try different dishes and not pay full price. 

Personally, I think they have an exceptional Chicken Parm. The Spaghetti is great, too. The meatballs are a bit spicy so I don't order it very often. I absolutely refuse to come here and not split the Crispy Brussels Sprouts with Mrs. E. I think they add some secret concoction to make you crave them. A-D-D-I-C-T-I-N-G!!!!!!

When we arrived, it was kind of strange because the place was deserted. The waitress/hostess that greeted us was very friendly and sat us immediately. She was friendly and professional. The only concern I have is that she wore an extreme amount of perfume. It made me gag when she came by the table to ask us for drinks. Also, when she brought the bread and olive oil, the bottom of the bread was rockhard. The top was soft however we could not cut through the bottom without a saw. Our server care of this immediately. It was kind of hard to taste the bread with the perfume wafting around us. 

The price has definitely increased as the bottle of wine was quoted at $48. I remember just before Covid being here and the bottle is $32. So I asked for a wine list. She said they did not have one but she knew everything about the wines. Luckily I had an old picture of the wine menu and showed it to her. She went to check the prices and then quoted me $38 for a bottle and apologized. It is somewhat difficult to not have the ability to look at the list of wines and their prices. Especially when you were quoted $16 more than the last time you visited.

What we ordered:

Drinks: went with a bottle of wine. My wife likes sweeter wines so I ordered a bottle of Reisling (Chateau St. Michelle) 

Lamb Shank 
Steak and mash
Grilled asparagus 

The food is extremely good. The lamb shank pulled apart with a fork. The steak was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor. My wife really loved the style of mashed potatoes. For a side of asparagus, it seemed a bit small. But it was definitely cooked nicely.

I do hope the waitress reads this review and adjust her perfume. With a sidenote, if you wear the same perfume over and over, sometimes you get desensitized to the smell and you have to apply more so you can smell it. Overtime this builds up and the result is suffocating for others. 

Other than this, it was a nice visit and we will return.",9OG5YkX1g2GReZM0AskizA,Romano's Macaroni Grill,Reno,2.5,-119.7893392,39.4761165,"Restaurants, Italian","{'Monday': '11:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '10:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-20:0', 'Friday': '11:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-21:0'}",5505 S Virginia St,NV

A kind of ciabatta bread with balsamic and olive oil was brought to us and we tore up pieces to enjoy. Soft, tasty and went nice with the dipping oil and vinegar. 
We ordered Mac n cheese balls and bruschetta to share as a starter. We enjoyed both but I particularly enjoyed the bruschetta. A bowl of sauced chopped tomatoes to dump on some really soft delicious slices of baguette. Yum. Mac n cheese bites were good as well with a nice crunchy exterior.

The first was basically cold potato salad, pretty much the same as I could pick up at Kroger. The dumplings were bland and flavorless, the curry udon was basically a bowl of mush, and while the trout was good, it could have been trout from any southern restaurant and didn't ring of Japanese flavors at all. The only dish that we enjoyed that had the expected flavoring was the Broccolini with rock shrimp, which was pretty good. 1 for 6 isn't great.

The drinks were fine but not particularly special at 14 bucks each. The waitress described the atmosphere as a neighborhood Japanese pub but it's just another upscale dining establishment in a town full of them. The ambience or atmosphere is the same as any other in town.

Overall, it was not a terrible meal, but not really a good meal either. Just kind of a dud (and an expensive dud at that) in a town full of much better restaurants.

In particular, we ordered a selection of raw fish on a bed of sushi rice first. This was the most expensive item we ordered, but it was worth it!

Liked both of my dishes and the trout was firm but not overcooked.  My wife felt that it needed more flavor and asked for salt which helped.  The trout dish needs some type of side sauce (hate to say tartar but perhaps an Asian version with wasabi/ginger) to dip. Would return.

End up having no room for dessert lol. Overall, there's one thing that's a little bothering, every dish is too salty for us.

1169,4.0,"My husband and I went to The Green Pheasant for dinner before attending the symphony this past Saturday, and we were both impressed! 

We had a reservation and were seated in the upstairs area of the restaurant after we walked in. Our waitress was LOVELY. She walked us through pretty much the whole menu as well as explaining some of the drink options as well. 

I started with a sake that the restaurant had on tap, which was wonderful. my husband tried one of their cocktails and then stuck with his favorite Manhattan after that. 

We started with the okonomiyaki (a Japanese pancake, at Green Pheasant made with ham, bacon, scallops, potatoes, and various traditional okonomi toppings). It was good, but not my favorite thing we ate. Next we tried the shumai (at Green Pheasant, made with lobster and spot prawn - and served with clover ponzu) - these were okay, but definitely my least favorite thing we ordered (they had a slightly strange flavor to me, but that may be because I'm so used to shumai made with shrimp only). 

Next we had the spicy crab noodles (with crab butter, sweet red crab, and tobanjan), which were very good. Lots of crab on the dish, and it was just the right amount of heat! 

But the Ikinari steak was my favorite of the appetizers or entrees we ordered! The steak was American skirt steak with corn and onion and miso brown butter and j sauce, served in a hot hot hot sizzle plate like is traditional at the Japanese steak restaurant chain Ikinari (picture a fajita platter at a Tex Mex restaurant). The steak was great (perfectly cooked); the corn and onions were charred where they had touched the hot sizzle plate; and the miso brown butter was just the right richness for the steak. I'd come back to Green Pheasant just to eat this again. A great dish.

But we didn't stop there. We ordered two of the desserts as well. I ordered the ginger creme brulee which was SENSATIONAL (I might be back at Green Pheasant again soon - I want to sit at the bar, order some sake or shochu, and eat the Ikinari steak and the ginger creme brulee. Quite simply one of the best desserts I've had recently. The ginger flavor was amazing, and the creme brulee was so smooth. I LOVED IT. My husband has about 10x the sweet tooth I do and he ordered the tempura fried slice of chocolate cake. I tried a teeny tiny bite, and it's just WAAAAAAY too rich and sweet for me, but he enjoyed it (definitely for people who love sweet, rich desserts only). 

We had a couple more drinks (including a shochu cocktail that was DELICIOUS). The service was excellent, and the restaurant pretty nice (I do think sitting downstairs is probably nicer, because upstairs is pretty sparse compared to the decor on the main level).

The entrees are really not shareable because most items are bite sizes like the 4 dumplings you can eat in 2 bites.

It's $26 per oz for a minimum of 4oz in very small print!!! We had a party of 10 and all of us read the menu wrong. That adds up to $104. We had 3 to share in our table so imagine the shock when we got the bill. $416 for 1lb of wagyu is highway robbery!! If we return I'd like to try the American wagyu.

1183,3.0,"With tall ceilings, long wide windows, and green velvet furniture, The Green Pheasant is a good looking place. On a cool and rainy winter night it felt kind of drafty and chilly. But we were excited to check out this new place. 
The menu is simple and split up into two sections: cold and hot. Since it was so chilly we only got one thing from the cold menu: the Tsukemono. I think of Tsukemono as pickled vegetables and was expecting such, but instead got a mixed greens salad with some chunks of raw fish in it. The chunks of raw fish were quite good, and though it seemed like scraps from other raw fish plates, we enjoyed it. I love scraps and not wasting!
We then moved onto our hot plates. When we asked our waitress about the order and timing she promised all of our dishes would not arrive at the same time and she was right. They all arrived at the same time except for the one larger dish we had ordered. Eh, a few kinks to a new restaurant.  I understand. 
The dishes:
Dan Dan shishito. I love Dan dan Mian the spicy Sichuan noodle dish and I like shishito peppers so we got this. It was a competition on the plate: the shishito vs the dan dan. There is not room in the bowl for two such strong flavors! Neither won. 
We then got the kinoko: warm mushrooms with finely grated cheese on top. A salty warm cheesy dish which felt good on a drafty evening. A small bowl for $13 or so but who's counting?
The star of the night was the stuffed chicken wings: the tebasaki gyoza. The bone removed from the meaty half of the wing and a shrimp toast mixture stuffed in, it was warm, savory and my favorite. Three wings on a plate if you were wondering how many to order for a table. 
Finally we got the trout: a good idea of a whole trout lightly fried with cold slaw and three little steamed bread pieces to make your own little baozi
of fish and slaw. Fish was a little overdone and slaw was a little mayo-naisey for our taste. I think we would have preferred a sharper crisper more vinegar heavy slaw. 
Overall, I think it has potential, but needs to work on some execution and pricing. I mean $22 for a bowl for potato udon?

1187,5.0,"Everything about The Green Pheasant impressed me. The brass hardware paired with bright teal chairs and elevated ceilings gave an upscale, opulent ambiance that I love and is the perfect setting for a fantastic Friday night meal. We met some friends here for the first time and decided to order a lot of things and share. We ordered cocktails, mine was a lemongrass drink with gin that was delicious and the rest of the table had cold sake. For our cold starter we had the wedges which typically I'm not a big fan of a giant stalk of lettuce as a general rule, but this one was cut up into smaller pieces with a hibachi dressing and crispy onions which were delicious. For the warm courses we ordered two kinds of gyozas, one being the stuffed chicken wings which were unlike anything I've ever had and incredibly interesting. They were warm and flavorful and stuffed with a blend of what I think was shrimp and other seasonings. It's hard to describe, but just get them. We also had the dan dan shishito peppers which I have to order whenever they are on a menu and were very good. I think my favorite dish of the night was the spicy crab noodles. They were good because they were actually spicy for a spice lover, and rich but not too heavy unlike other crab noodles I've had. They were incredible and melted in my mouth. I completely hogged the dish and was not as generous with them as I normally am when ordering shared plates. We also sampled a pork special that was great and had a really good sashimi which I think was the walu on the cold menu.

It was odd because each time we tried something we'd all look at each other and say ""interesting!""  The tuna tartare was not my favorite. Though an interesting presentation, it honestly lost the actual tuna in the dish!  The chirashi was also underwhelming. The lobster shumai was just average. 

On the positive side we really liked the Japanese pancake dish a lot. It had potato, ham and a nice little crunch/sauce. Quite tasty. The spicy crab noodles were also good.

The bartender really saved me from rating this restaurant one star down, here's why:

I ordered a Chirashi bowl, and when I asked for wasabi, I was upcharged $5 for wasabi that wasn't even good - the wasabi was tasteless. Consider being upcharged for wasabi with your sushi - that's like getting charged for ketchup with your fries, or getting charged for butter with your toast. Just doesn't make sense. I also had to wait an extra amount of time to get the wasabi and soy sauce. Since I didn't know about this charge while ordering, I passed the $ threshold in my bill where I now have to go submit an expense report. What an annoyance! The rice was on the stiffer side, and the fish was cut into small cubes, which is not ideal. 

The bartender apologized for having to upcharge me, and his kindness made up for it. Otherwise I would've left the restaurant sort of pissed.

When we walked in the music was positively blaring. When we said something to our server he told us that we were not the first, but the fourth person to complain. When they turned it down, it hardly made any difference. I started with the tuna tartare with crispy rice. We thought they brought out the wrong dish because the tuna was unrecognizable, looking like chopped liver on rice. (See photo). They charged for soy sauce and for wasabi which I have never seen before at a Japanese restaurant. They are trying to get rid of the American influences so did not have the American whiskies on the menu. The food was doused in butter and you could hardly taste the Japanese flavors in any of the dishes. My lips were puckered because the food is so over salted. And to seal the deal, we found a hair mixed into the rice of our chirashi. I will not be coming back. At the end of our meal, the a server came out and let us know he saw our review. Rather than apologizing for the poor service and our bad experience, he could not have been more unkind. One of the wait staff walked us out of the restaurant telling us how pathetic we are.

We were sitting near the entrance of the restaurant and another group of people walked in and stated that they did not have a reservation, however they were quickly seated at a table. My friend and I went on to order a drink and start with a small plate. The small plate we had was the lobster dumplings and they were extremely salty, we could hardly taste the lobster meat.

We stopped in for lunch and I got yakisoba; wok fired noodles, pork, vegetables with a sunny egg and my husband ordered a sando set, a la bento box-esque with pork katsu. His meal came with miso soup, side of the day, rice, and pickled veggies. The veggies in my dish were super fresh and bright. The chopped asparagus was a nice touch. To round it out we ordered two house sakes (cold) with our meal for $6 a glass.The food was on point and we were very satisfied. I wasn't too full, it was just the right amount. 

The decor is fantastic and romantic. They used a lot of deep jewel tones in the fabrics. The booths were microfiber in a deep burnt orange color and others were a deep blue. The chairs were a little mod and the bar open. The booths were tucked away where you could get some privacy. The tables evoked more of a traditional dining experience. 

To say I was surprised would be incorrect, this team knows what they are doing and consistently delivers top notch food. Two Ten is one of my favorite restaurants in town! I can't wait to come back to the Green Pheasant and try more of their food. There are at least 10 more items I need to eat. This is a must try downtown.

We ordered the kinoko (mushrooms) and these were the best thing of the meal in my opinion. Lastly, we decided to stop at the spicy crab noodles. I was really looking forward to this dish and I was let down again. It was basically Alfredo sauce with crab meat and hint of heat. Overall the food was underwhelming.

Service is top notch.  Our server was willing to give us a complete run-down of the menu, noting all of his favorites and specials along the way.  He also gave us some recommendations on saki to try, since it was my first time ever tasting it.  

The saki was good, but not quite my thing, so I ended up with the 'bad sleep well' as my cocktail of choice for the night.  It was so refreshing and delicious.

As far as food goes, I definitely recommend getting a few small plates and entrees to split amongst the table, so you can get a taste of everything.  There were just two of us, so we started with the shishito peppers and the tebasaki gyoza (which is a really cool play on chicken wings and gyozas).  Those gyozas were definitely our favorite!  For our main course we split a pork belly ramen special that was delicious!

Started off with the wedge and this I can not recommend highly enough. Who would have ever thought a ""wedge"" could be done uniquely on a stick? Crunchy onions on top and that dressing.... I have decided to try to imitate that one at home - it won't be the same, but just the presentation - yum. The cauliflower was highly recommended and we all decided it was the least impressive of the evening. The ikineri steak was amazing - large portion and quite tender.

The spirits and sake list is located under the table in a secret pocket. They have a sake somm. Who is very knowledgeable about her selection and it's not small by any means, the Japanese whisky list is also very impressive I got to try a few whisky's I haven't tried yet.

We started with a few cold items the wedges which were awesome very light crisp and full of flavor, first off everything is full of flavor. The tsukemono was perfectly seasoned and fresh, the chirashi was also very fresh and had walu, oprah, and ora king salmon. I definitely reccomend starting with the cold before the hot because the dishes come out as ready. After chatting with the sake somm. And ordering a bottle of the otokoyama we ordered from the hot list. Jesse our waiter was very helpful with our questions and very attentive to our table. We ordered the (pics available) Dan Dan shishitos, the brocolini with rock shrimp (order this please) the kinoko which is a mushroom miso flavor bomb, the ika karaage which is basically tempura squid, the spicy crab noodle is a must every noodle is covered in great sauce the noodles al dente (another please order)the shuman came next and they didn't disappoint either but now I'm starting to think I ordered too much oops... on to the Jidori chicken a never ever chicken and I don't mean not to order it, it was fried to perfection came with a kewpie mayo and a sweet and spicy sauce. I just meant it's a strain of chicken that's DNA has never been tampered with by humans and is raised in completely open pens not the kind PETA shows in those tapes and fed an organic Vegan diet. On to the beef I'm dying a happy death at this point... the first two to show up was the mishima ranch American wagyu and the A5 miyazaki prefecture wagyu both very tender and cooked to perfection the American wagyu has more bite to it but the A5 is like seared foie gras melt in your mouth yummy goodness. Last but not least the American skirt steak showed up ... truly a sizzling flavor bomb the corn the onions the miso butter and the j sauce make sure to get everything in one bite for the perfect bite. I've been writing so much I forgot to talk about the trout just check the pictures ... kudos to chef Kynsey and her amazing staff the GM Michael seale for coming to the table and chatting with us Kristin breringson for the awesome recommendations and most of all Jesse for taking care of us and making sure put needs were met.

The ambiance and decor is unparalleled. Lush green velvet everywhere, high ceilings, origami centerpieces hanging above the bar. 

The food was absolutely marvelous and subtly balanced Southern and Japanese influence. We had the mushroom dish, the walu, the spicy crab noodles, and the whole trout. 

The mushrooms were divine. The walu was so delicate with just a little spice. The spicy crab noodles had the best slightly chewy texture, the crab itself was a very fine texture and flavored the noodles, and it had just the right amount of heat in the back of your throat. The trout was amazing because of the salted crust, the meat just fell off the bones. We made little buns with their upscale cole slaw and it was jaw dropping.

1242,5.0,"My wife and I spent three days in Nashville in a food and booze coma and we both agreed that our dinner at the Green Pheasant was far and away our best meal. Things got off to an inauspicious start as we barely made our reservation and the host staff gave my wife a hard time about being alone as I refused to pay the going rate for parking nearby or the posted valet price ($5 self park is available, oops missed that). Once we finally got settled in, our server took over and he was outstanding. 

We ordered a bottle of wine and a number of dishes to share. Everyone raves about the spicy crab noodles and for good reason. Ours could have been a touch hotter in my opinion but once I had that first butter savory umami bite I couldn't part with it. I would come back here often just for this dish alone. We also fell in love with the Tebasaki gyoza. At first when they brought it to our table we were confused as we expected some traditional dumplings, but when our waiter explained how the dumpling filling is stuffed into the chicken wing we raised our eyebrows a bit, took a bite and were astounded at the taste and experience of such an innovative concept. It's hard to surprise me with food and yet this did. My wife still talks about this dish and for good reason. Mindblowingly amazing! We had the broccolini and shrimp dish as well which was fantastic, but compared to the other dishes we ordered, was not in the same stratosphere. Great but not innovative or life-changing. We had the cheapest steak on their menu, which in hindsight I wish I would have insisted on the wagyu or something, but my wife devoured the american steak and claimed it as her favorite steak for some time (I assume that excludes my weekly sous vide offerings). I found the steak befitting of the other dishes and the exquisite ambiance. As much as I enjoyed it, I would def order the crab noodles and gyoza again, but would be interested in trying a different steak next time. 

The restaurant is gorgeous, elegant and stately without being pretentious or overstated. We would definitely return regularly and I know if I were ever in the doghouse, a visit to the Green Pheasant would be just the ticket to get me back in my wife's good graces.

I told the waitress I was in the mood for ramen and she recommend the ""most traditional"" which was the shio wontonmen. I can't even describe how tasteless this ramen was, it had no flavor at all. It was cold noodles in a watered down wonton soup. I didn't finish either one, got our checks and left.

The atmosphere was super cute, food was good our server, Matthew was atrocious. We had to ask him repeatedly for multiple things and one of the most important things was water. Water is one thing you shouldn't let run out with customers. 
It took them a significantly (20 mins) longer time to bring out my friends food and she ordered the same thing. Then when it was brought out, wrong might I add, he had an attitude about it and did not offer another option or apologize about the issue. 
Overall I'm not sure if I'll come back to this restaurant let alone recommend this place to anyone else. Now when people ask me about it, the first thing that comes out is food was good, but the service is terrible and that's such a turn off. Very dissatisfied.

The interior and service were astounding. We were promptly seated and given warm, damp towels to wash our hands at the table. That's something I've never seen before but apparently it's a custom at legitimate Japanese establishments, especially higher budget ones. Our server was very polite and the whole place gave off a formal vibe. I definitely wouldn't come here on a whim in your Wednesday Worst but don't feel pressured to come in a suit or dress. Anyways, the menu items were expectantly  priced for the type of venue Green Pheasant was. I don't think anything was below $10 and one of their entrees was around $25 per ounce (minimum of 4 ounces per order) for examples. Even though the price can be a bit steep, the food was well worth it and tasted delicious. You get an adequate and satisfying portion unlike some more higher end places so you don't feel like you paid for one little piece of meat or lettuce.

I planned a surprise birthday dinner for my best friend here, and everything from the moment I called to inquire about availability was flawless and above average customer service.  Karah, the manager I spoke with, worked closely with me to make sure all details were handled, down to prepping the hostesses not to mention a party when I arrived with the birthday girl.  Karah not only helped me the day I called (a week or so before the party), but reached out the day of to go over final details.  She was enthusiastic and thorough.  In fact, she even came by to wish the birthday girl a happy birthday and stopped back a few times to ask if everything was going well. 

Our server, Duane was flawless!  He gave us an enthusiastic overview of the restaurant, it's food and suggestions.  He explained everything extremely well and made our experience personal and exceptional.  He always had a smile on his face and gave wonderful suggestions, i.e. the onset egg on the wagyu steak!  

The FOOD!  THE FOOD THE FOOD!  We spent roughly $1200 for a group of 13 and there wasn't a crumb left on any of the plates!  People made NOISE while eating.  The food is so well prepared, came out in waves (never allowing anything to get cold, it came out immediately when ready), very well presented and perfect for a large group to share.  The cocktails were delicious as well.

Upon arrival the restaurant was dimly lit and smelled delicious. We were seated at a table by the window. Our server, Jason, promptly brought hot towels. I thought it was a nice touch.

After reviewing the wine menu we decided to go with a bottle of Italian red. 

For an appetizer we ordered the pheasant dumplings. These things were AMAZING. Tangy and not to filling, we absolutely destroyed them instantly.

For the entree we decided to go with the Japanese wagyu with a side of roasted cauliflower. I highly recommend these delicious cuts of beef if you decide to come here. It arrived on a slate platter with 4 optional topics. We sprinkled the salt and pepper over the top and began to enjoy. The wagyu was everything I hoped and dreamed for it to be. Thinly sliced with a charred exterior, we went with rare plus, every piece was savory and delicious. It was like candy. The pictures do not do it justice!

Guess I was deemed needy, but she was away for long periods at a time. I added lobster tails to our dinner for $10 each. They were the size of a shriveled shrimp. I guess I got what I paid for, but I can get a full lobster tail somewhere else for like $25. The NYE dinner was alright. Wouldn't pay $85 a person here again though. Wagyu wasn't that great, & dessert was just a bunch of mochi that I didn't care for. Serving sizes are tapa sized portions. Even for the entree.

We got there at 5:10 and were put on the waitlist for the Ramen off. At around 5:25 we went up to the hostess stand (there were 3 hostesses) and asked if we could be taken off the list for the event and just dine in downstairs. The hostess asked us to hold on a ""moment"" and she would seat us. 20 minutes rolls by and it looks like she has no intention to seat us. I asked another hostess who said she couldn't seat us until the person who controlled the seating was back and she was currently on the phone. Again, at least half or more of the tables are open. Another 10-15 minutes till around and that second hostess seats us, in the back of the dining hall, without any apology or care we had to wait for over 30 minutes to sit. I also didn't understand why we were seated in the back when there were plenty of open tables in the front of the restaurant. 

Our service was decent but I felt like she was in a rush. I understand it might have been stressful because an event was taking place upstairs.

The cocktails are good depending on what you get, but I don't know if they're ""$14 good."" 

The food we ordered was the Tuna Tartare (it was excellent, and my favorite), the Shumai dumplings (my friend liked these, I didn't care for them), the hash browns (these were also very delicious and a nice spin on a traditional American food), and the spicy crab noodles (also pretty good).

All in all, the food is good, the restaurant is beautiful, but for me I appreciate an overall experience and if I feel like a burden to the staff I guarantee you I won't come back no matter how good the food can be.

1261,2.0,"Disappointed

I made my reservation for a party of 6 two months ago after hearing incredible reviews from co-workers and friends. I was eagerly anticipating a first class experience, an upscale version of another local favorite,Two-Ten Jack. Unfortunately, due to the restaurant management's incompetence and extremely rude and unprofessional attitudes, I left this establishment very disappointed. 

Our reservation was at 7:30pm, and when we arrived, the hostess informed us that our table ""was being cleared now"" and to take a seat at the bar for a few minutes. After a quick bathroom break, our party ordered a round of drinks from the bar to help us maintain our patience as the minutes melted off of the clock. After 20 minutes of waiting; I approached the host to inquire about the delay in seating. The response was gruff, he rudely informed me that a previous party was still closing out at the table and we would have to continue to wait. I then asked if he would comp our first round of drinks; and again the response was rude and unprofessional- ""It's out of my control....Sir!"" the manager exclaimed as he shook his head and walked towards the kitchen. 

My party and I continued to wait; ordering a second round of drinks while the waitstaff struggled to get their act together. 50 minutes later, at 8:20pm, the manager finally moped back to the bar; mumbling as he led us upstairs to a completely different section of the restaurant. Before we headed upstairs, I asked him what he would do to help rectify the situation. ""The first round of drinks is on me, but I will NOT cover the second."" Ridiculous.... 

Once we were seated, I must confess that the remainder of our time was quite enjoyable. From our friendly waiter, Spencer, delicious small plates, and smooth Japanese Whiskey- the second act of the night met my expectations. The heated toilet seats were also a big hit with the ladies. However, none of these positives could cleanse my palate of the sour taste left over from the management's poor demeanor. We shook our heads as we departed; disheartened.

For our main, we shared the spicy crab noodle with crab butter, sweet red crab, tobanjan. And again, nothing to write home about. The creme brule definitely takes the cake here.

1265,5.0,"Most of Nashville's new restaurants, while quite good, are not that different from each other.  The Green Pheasant is different.  Japanese-  But far from your average (or even above average) sushi restaurant.  Expect truly interesting, even strange, dishes with SUPERB flavors.  Subtle or powerful depending, light or rich, depending on the dish-  the food here is truly remarkable.  And, you will find dishes you likely have never experienced, (but are worth the try!!) as well as some to please the less than adventurous eater.  If you have never had Japanese wagyu beef -  it's is rare to find it in the US and is considered some of the best beef available in the world.  I'm not a sake fan-  (even cold sake, which is THE thing now) but they have trained sake specialists to help you select!  The wait staff was super knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  
The decor and atmosphere is wonderful, with tables having a good amount of space between them so there is some privacy.

1266,2.0,I went with a group of ten ladies on z weeknight. I ordered the chicken small plate at $22. I disliked it and asked the waitress to box the remaining in case somebody in my household would like it. Half the table wanted to share plates and half the table ordered a solo plate for themselves because we did not want a large meal. The restaurant was not able to accommodate this when it came time to billing. So those of us that ordered one item as an entree were not able to get our own check. Nobody in my household like the chicken dish so not a good evening for dining out. The valet parking was a fixed $12 per car.  We were in a beautifully decorated private room.  The group was largely not overwhelmed with the flavors and their menu selections.,tMkwHmWFUEXrC9ZduonpTg,The Green Pheasant,Nashville,4.0,-86.7731974,36.1598858,"Restaurants, Japanese, Seafood","{'Wednesday': '16:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-22:0', 'Friday': '16:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '16:0-23:0'}",215 1st Ave S,TN

And for me, the food has to be great & interesting, and Green Pheasant scores highly here too.  I have had the Karaage (Japanese fried chicken) each time.  It melts in your mouth, and even though it looks like chicken nuggets, the flavor is tremendous.  I recommend eating it while still hot, as it just tastes better before it cools.  I have also had the gyoza, yakisoba, and tuna tartare.  All were very good.  Small plates is the way I like to eat, and this place fits nicely into that ability to try different things, and not get too full at mid-day.

1268,5.0,"$129.77 later without tax or tip and 12,977% worth the money spent. Yes, baby, yes! Can I get an hallelujah?! I am screaming at the top of my lungs for The Green Pheasant. Alas, I have found my date night spot. Now, if only I had a date to take with me!

That was pretty exciting first paragraph, wasn't it? The breakdown is pretty clear. When you arrive, valet the car with the restaurant. Just do it and quit groaning at the suggestion. This will make your life a whole lot easier for a stress-free starter to your date. Go to the hostess desk where they will seat you for your reservation that you made 2 weeks ago. As they take you to your table, observe the ambiance. Will they take you to the upstairs with the quirky bathrooms? Will they take you to the main dining room where there is a central bar to people watch or are they going to take you to your private dining room with the awesome wallpaper of CCTV cameras and roses? Yes, you read that right. If you are able, take some photos in there because the wallpaper is totally worth a photo of. Most of the restaurant should find itself in a covershoot in Nashville Scene. Who doesn't love green and red velvet everywhere!?

Now that you're seated, take it all in. Check out the menu and inhale all of the quirky offerings on the menu. But before ordering food, get your sake order in and prepare for a toast! You can get that unique cocktail you were eyeing in the next round. This round is about sharing the moment you realized you're about to have one of the best damn dining experiences in Nashville. Kanpai! ('Cheers' in Japanese)

You've looked over the menu and you're going to order 4-5 items between you and your dining companion. They offer everything from vegetarian to what I'd consider a very large unsightly fish on a plate ready for consumption. I don't like whole fish, but the table next to us certainly did! Whatever you palette wishes is Green Pheasant's command.

The experience exceeds just the dining portion. Let's talk service. Carlos was exceptional. Beyond words, topnotch, never missed a beat, glowing service. He was hospitable, prompt, and very nurturing to our table. He never hoovered and we never had to ask for anything. He was like a genie who appeared when I had a fleeting thought of needing a beverage or another glass of water. We also appreciated his knowledge of the cuisine and his mindfulness of our spice-level tolerance. We ordered based on his recommendations and we loved every last thing he suggested.

After 2.5 hours of eating and drinking, it is time to go. Time to wrap up and get going. But, you do not exit without leaving a gigantic tip for the awesome server you just had, and you do not omit grabbing a couple of photos of yourself with your dining partner to capture the experience that will be ingrained in your culinary memory for a life time. Bask in the moment while you can. You'll return soon, but in the meantime, enjoy the moment at this moment.

Have fun? I know I did. Check it out and do it soon!",tMkwHmWFUEXrC9ZduonpTg,The Green Pheasant,Nashville,4.0,-86.7731974,36.1598858,"Restaurants, Japanese, Seafood","{'Wednesday': '16:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-22:0', 'Friday': '16:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '16:0-23:0'}",215 1st Ave S,TN
1269,5.0,"This was our final dinner in Nashville.  We didn't have this one planned out, rather looked at online reviews for nice Asian because we had already had so much heavy, fried cuisine.  This place was a gem!

I called ahead for a reservation but they were booked up for most of the night.   I was told we could sit at the bar and it would be best to come early.   We actually arrived before their dinner hours began, so we sat at the bar and ordered from their small plates.  

Mike was very friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  He concocted a great non-alcoholic drink for me, which I ordered a few of over the course of our meal!   I can't remember exactly what it was, I believe it was made of cranberry juice, soda water, and a generous sprig of rosemary (picture attached).

We started with the edamame, yaki gyoza (pheasant dumplings), tuna tartare, and lobster shumai (lobster and corn dumplings).  Everything was nicely plated and tasted wonderful.

Next up were the famed spicy crab noodles.  Upon arrival of this dish, we quickly realized: a) that it was so good that we had to order another, b) that it was so good that my spouse was going to eat it all so we had to order another, and c) that it was so good that I wasn't going to want to share the dish with my spouse, so we had to order another!  So, we immediately ordered another!   

Also--interesting find--the toilet seats were heated!  

This is a very unique establishment and we were glad to have the opportunity to visit it!   We were happy to find such a friendly place with fresh ingredients and very unique selections for our last big meal in Nashville!",tMkwHmWFUEXrC9ZduonpTg,The Green Pheasant,Nashville,4.0,-86.7731974,36.1598858,"Restaurants, Japanese, Seafood","{'Wednesday': '16:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-22:0', 'Friday': '16:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '16:0-23:0'}",215 1st Ave S,TN
1270,5.0,"We decided to spend our pre-Thanksgiving Tuesday at the Green Pheasant last night. We were not disappointed! The space is sleek, cool and comfortable. The nonstop ""house"" music was a bit much, and made it somewhat hard to hear dinner conversation, but we understood the vibe that they were shooting for and took it all in stride. The menu is a fantastic mix of classic Japanese izakaya dishes with some larger plates that are great for sharing. I'm not a big fan of menus that list the name of the dish followed by all of the ingredients without an actual description of the preparation, but our server was very familiar with the menu and talked us through everything. We had two of their craft cocktails; they were spot on perfect. Each was a great mix of sweet, sour, bitter and refreshing. 
We ordered Dan Dan Shishito peppers; very reminiscent of Dan Dan Mian,  without the heaviness of the noodles. A great started. That was followed by lobster and spot prawn shu mai; unlike many restaurant dishes that claim to feature lobster, the succulent crustacean was very present in this one. Then a riff on okonomiyaki; a hash brown pancake with traditional okonomiyaki toppings and sauces. It was like an asian latke; perfect for this time of year. We finished with the whole trout, fried and served with thinly sliced cucumbers, asian slaw and steamed buns. The trout was cooked perfectly; it was silky and juicy. One thing to note; for a restaurant that features a sharing menu, a puzzling number of items came out in odd numbers. 5 shu mai, three steamed buns with the trout; Management-how about 6 shu mai and 4 steamed buns so a pair of enthusiastic and hungry diners don't have to fight over the ""odd bun out""? 

In any event, the food was fabulous, and the bill for the meal, with 2 craft cocktails, came out to less than $100.

Worse part they charged us for the soy sauce, chill oil, and spices ($2-3 each). If you're in the mood for a flavorless $20 lunch, come here. Otherwise, keep walking.

1274,5.0,"The Green Pheasant is a fantastic addition to the Nashville food scene! 

Food: We had the Kinoko Mushroom Medley and Dandan Shishito Peppers -- both were fantastic. The broth/sauce in the mushroom dish was perhaps one of the best things I've eaten this year.

Bar Menu: Good selection of sake and other liquors. The staff are knowledgable and willing to help you find a sake that suits your palate. We had the whiskey barrel-aged sake which was served in a jar that you open yourself -- fun! Bartender Mike was friendly and remembered me the next time I came in.

Ambiance: The mid-century vibe meshed with Japanese culture seems a bit odd when you break it all down into individual parts but together, as a whole, the place is totally Nashville and just works. The decor is hip and on-trend while still sending out a warm and inviting ambiance. I LOVE the die-cut booth dividers which still let in light but create a nice division of space. 

My only wish would be for a more diverse Happy Hour drink menu, which currently features sake and beer. How about bubbly and whiskey?

1276,2.0,"The Green Pheasant was probably one of the worst dining experiences I've had to date and I dine out frequently, globally, so I feel I've got decent perspective. It started with check-in and seating. When we arrived, the two hosts, clearly flustered and whom I felt badly for if I'm being honest as they were overwhelmed, were arguing with each other over a table that had been somehow mis-seated. They audibly (and in front of other guests) tried to work this issue out but meanwhile let other guests linger in the very small waiting area in the front without explanation. 

After checking-in at 8:10pm for our 8:15pm reservation, we were told our table wasn't yet ready and when we asked approximately how long the wait would be, we were told ""tables are just lingering, so please head to the bar."" Anyone who's worked in the Industry understands occasionally this happens after check drops, especially on weekends, however to my surprise upon walking in the dining room I observe multiple open tables/tables that need to be serviced and flipped. 

We are forced to sit at the bar (where the service was really less than stellar and/or quick) until 8:45pm and I'm convinced the only reason we got a table is because a member of our party kept continually checking in with the host to inquire about our reservation. 

Once seated (and starving), we received a brief apology from our server and he noted that this ""happens around the 8pm reservation time sometimes,"" so it seems like this seating delay is a common problem Green Pheasant is aware of. We immediately ordered some dishes because we were starving. Since the first two were raw foods, they were delivered to us fairly quickly. The rest took FOREVER. We were told the kitchen was very backed up and they'd come out as they were ready. To say this was frustrating after our wait to be seated was an understatement. 

I observed a manager on the restaurant floor in our area only once throughout the night. He never did a table touch to ask about or experience in general, or to apologize for the wait for the table or food delays. There was no good faith gesture of any sort or acknowledgement from the restaurant regarding our experience beyond the very brief apology from our server, who obviously doesn't control the kitchen volume. 

The food was decent but to be honest, I was so hungry by the time any food came out, I would have eaten just about anything. 

To summarize, I would never return to The Green Pheasant and am baffled by the positive reviews of this restaurant given what I experienced, observed, and discussed with fellow diners while at the restaurant.

1281,1.0,"I do not understand the 5 star reviews. We really wanted to love this place. The restaurant is beautiful and the concept is admirable. However the food is very disappointing. 
We started with shishito peppers which turned out to be the best of what we had tonight. Good but not so great I would return just for that. We had the tuna tartar which had a decent flavor but was warm and chopped up so much that one would wonder if they were trying to hide that they were using poor quality tuna. Imagine room temperature cat food on top of warm rice cake. The whole thing did not work. 
Then to the entree. The steak was good but salty. The spicy crab pasta which is their signature dish came out cold and way after the steak. When we told the waiter it was cool, we were told it was because the noodle was rinsed and would never be piping hot. I'm sorry but a bit warmer than cold doesn't cut it. This was also very salty and I was told it was because I asked for spicy and they added chili sauce. Really?  The chef does not know how to make things spicier without making it so salty you can't eat?  So to save time and by this point my husband had already finished his steak so I asked for some plain hot noodles to be added. 
They brought some dumplings while waiting which was a nice touch but please don't bother ordering. They are less than tasty. 

Finally the noodles came out and they added garlic butter which made the plain pasta salty again. JAPANESE FOOD DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SALTY. 
By now we were ready to get out of this pretentious place. The bill came out and they had charged us 14 for the noodles. So they charged 26 for salty lukewarm entree that was not edible as it was, then charged 14 more for what I had hoped to be warm plain noodles. So basically we were asked to pay 40 for a mediocre dish. We complained and they took it off the bill but that should have never happened.

The food is expensive and our dishes were bland. The food and drinks are expensive. The food arrived at our table without thought, so we received a hot dish at the same time that we received a cold dish. We stood at the bar another day and the hostess kept badgering our group to move even though the restaurant was empty at that time. She was fairly obnoxious. If a bar doesn't want patrons to stand it can provide more seats or extend the bar seating into the restaurant area. The restaurant makes more profit from its drinks than its food in any case. On the bright side, the commodes are wonderful and are like the commodes one finds in Japan.

1292,5.0,"I want to make sure everyone knows just how good and accommodating the service was here first and foremost and not to take attention away from how great the food was.  We made reservations for 8:30 and our table was a little behind so we headed to the bar for a pre dinner cocktail.  Sake on tap is pretty cool and in my opinion a great drink to order before and with dinner here.  My date had forgotten her id....on her bday...and after she returned the bartender bought her a drink.  Didn't have to just did it out of kindness and made sure to get it to our table.  Thank you Mike!  The hostesses at the door kept us informed and were very polite when our table became ready.  Our seat was in one of the crushed velvet booths and was comfortable and could easily sit 4 just as comfortably to share all of our dishes with.  The food is served tapas style and arrives quickly to your table.  Our server was well informed about the menu and all employees were eager to share personal menu favorites as well as popular patron choices.  The okonomiyaki, spicy crab noodle and ikinari steak was our favorites out of the 4 plates we ordered and plenty for 2 people.  The fourth dish was the tebasaki gyoza not my style but was still very flavorful and with a crispy outer crunch.  I was surprised at the check expecting it to be more for a night out but was very affordable for a beginning of a fun date night!  We are excited to go back and try everything on the menu and I would love to come back for the lunch menu.  

A few tips:
1. Don't eat all day before you go,  you will want the extra room!
2. Everything is unique and delicious don't be afraid to explore!
3. The miso butter on the steak is very good,  we mixed it into the hot      plate with everything but next time might try it on the side for dipping.  It wasn't bad but I think we overpowered the other flavors with all the butter.
4. Repeat, don't eat before you go!

While the pickles were ok, I was disappointed with the quality of fish. Some small and bigger cut pieces to start off, but the moon fish was really chewy and I had to tell them about it.
They offered to redo the entire dish only to come back with the same issues. Sounds like the chef doesn't care that some fish cuts shouldn't be served like this.
Anyways, for dessert I had their tempura chocolate cake: rich, sweet and not too oily, so it was quite good.

1297,5.0,"We had an outstanding meal at the Green Pheasant on Tuesday night this week. I went in with high expectations and they were exceeded. 

We started with the Broccolini (shrimp, crumbled corn bread, and broccolini). The broccolini was bright and crisp-tender. The shrimp were perfectly cooked. It seemed like an unusual combination of flavors and textures but it totally worked. 

We also tried the Shumai starter (dumplings filled with lobster and shrimp and sitting in a ponzu sauce). They may have been my favorite dish of the night. Perfection. 

For our larger plates, my husband and I shared the ora king salmon and the spicy crab noodle. The salmon was outstanding. It had a crispy charred side that tasted like cotton candy (in the best possible way). The salmon was served with bok choy which was perfectly cooked and paired nicely with the salmon. The spicy crab noodles were absurdly delicious as well. We fought over every last bite. 

As a party of two, this ended up being the perfect amount of food for us. We were full when we left, but not stuffed. 

Green Pheasant is great for date night or girls' night out. It's also perfectly positioned if you are headed to Ascend.

Chicken wings were certainly creative just not tasty - all it tasted like was fryer. Lobster dumplings were too buttery and we had about one each and left the rest. Edamame was fine, steamed with salt, nothing distinctive. Salmon was very tasty but almost raw. The noodles everyone raves about were good,  not as spicy as I would have loved.

1299,5.0,"I applaud you, Green Pheasant. I'm not sure to whom I am applauding--their interior designers, the servers, the chefs, but everyone gets a big high five. This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Nashville. The meal was exceptional from start to finish. 

The service--
We had made a reservation on Resy through their website and we were seated promptly on-time. When we were seated we were brought warm towels to wipe our hands. Our server greeted us and was very accommodating. She was the best! 

The ambiance--
There was a slight Asian flavor to the decor but everything was very modern. Some of the seating had plush booths and some were tables. There was a center bar for people who just came to get drinks. The restrooms were very clean and to our amusement and delight they had  Japanese toilets which had a seat warming feature. 

The food--
Their menu consists of a cold section and a hot section. There aren't appetizers but the menu is mostly small plates and then towards the bottom of the menu the plates get larger. Our server went into the most detail of the menu of any server that I've ever had. It was great. She highlighted her favorite dishes but gave an explanation of how the dishes were prepared so we knew what to expect. We ordered: 
-Spicy crab noodles: buttered noodles with crab meat. My favorite, but apparently also most people's favorite since our server has said that every table will likely have one order of these. 
-Tebasaki gyoza: This dish blew my mind. Instead of the chicken stuffed into a traditional gyoza dumpling, the gyoza is stuffed into the chicken wing. It is deboned except for the end of the wing so you are getting a crispy chicken with the filling of the gyoza in the center. 
-Kinoko: These were different kinds of mushroom with Parmesan. They had such a great earthy flavor and a light broth.
-Broccolini with corn bread and rock shrimp: This dish seemed like an interesting pairing but everything worked together. The sauce for the broccolini was delicious and the rock shrimp had a different seasoning which worked together
-Wedges: This was the one dish I could have done without, but it was still good. The salad was served on skewers with dressing and shaved carrots. 

The ambiance, the service and the food was all amazing. High marks for all. The dinner was very memorable and enjoyable.

My table each ordered something different and all our food was good. It is more of a smaller dish but of you order a couple things to share you will get full.

1301,4.0,"4.5 stars. I had dinner last night here for my birthday and it was delicious! I would recommend making a reservation though, especially on the weekend. Our reservation was at 8:30 and our table wasn't quite ready yet when we got there so we got a drink at the bar while we waited. Our table was ready about 15 minutes later at 8:45, but it was worth the wait because they seated us on the first level at a little booth with plush velvet, super comfortable!

Side note: do not forget your ID especially on your birthday! I'm embarrassed to say that I made this mistake (I had switched purses, it's a girl thing) so I had to run home to grab it. So it was fine that our table wasn't ready right away. And the bartender was so nice and felt bad that I had to run home he ended up buying my first drink! I believe his name was Mike, super friendly and great bartender. 

There was just two of us and we ordered 5 dishes which was the right amount of food for us. They are tapas style and made for sharing it seems. Our food also came out pretty quick. We were full by the end but not busting at the seams. They bring each dish out as they are ready instead of bringing it all out at once which I like so you're not waiting for a long time to eat. 

We started off with the wedge salad. It was skewers of lettuce with a ginger dressing on top. Fresh and tasty, although maybe a little pricey. 

Next we had the Okonomiyaki which was delicious. It was a crispy savory hashbrown type pancake with sauces and toppings on top. Highly recommend!

Then we had the Tebasaki Gyoza. Do not be fooled by the name, it is not a gyoza. It is actually a deboned chicken wing stuffed with a mixture of shrimp. There is a chili sauce for dipping. This is probably unusual for most people. The outer crust was super crispy which I loved. It had also come out super fresh and hot. A sign it was made to order and hadn't been sitting for a while. My boyfriend was so so about this dish, but I really liked it. So it depends on the person. 

After came the spicy crab noodles which had come highly recommended. It was very saucy and rich. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be although there was a good amount of crab in there. I would recommend mixing it up before you start as all of our crab and stuff had kind of settled towards the bottom. I didn't end up loving this dish as I had thought I would. The flavors were a bit muddled and maybe a little too rich for me. 

Lastly, we had the ikinari steak. It's American skirt steak on a bed of sweet corn and onions with a generous scoop of the miso butter. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and came out on a sizzling skillet. So for those who don't like their meet too rare, it does continue to cook a bit after it comes out. The steak was super tender and had a sauce on top. For me it could have had a little less sauce so the steak could shine, but still delicious nevertheless. It was a little difficult to eat the corn with chopsticks though haha. I could have asked for other utensils, but I didn't want to be ""that person.""

Overall it was a great experience. The decor instead was beautiful, with a mix of mid century furniture and more luxurious touches like the velvet booths. Everyone we encountered was friendly and our server was great, very knowledgeable and nice.

1304,4.0,"TGP has two stand-out features: Ambience (Read date night!) and rare ingredients. 

Compared to other haute cuisine restaurants, there are few of this grandeur. It is mid-century, dimly lit, with grand emerald green velvet seats and walls of the same color. It's going to give date night spots in town a run for the money. The vibe is upscale with house lounge music (loud and could be toned down). Plus, the serving ware is gorgeous. The dish added to the beauty of the dish. (I dunno how I felt about wooden chopsticks, though. It's definitely more practical, but did take away from the elegance). So just for the ambience TGP deserves more than 5 stars. 

TGP has a well curated menu. There is plenty to choose from, although vegetarian options maybe limited. They use fine quality ingredients like Jidori chicken, and mushrooms too fancy to google (kidding!). Also, there isn't sushi, ramen or yakitori for dinner. The portions are small, sharing size, but given Japanese cuisine is all about clean light and bright flavors, those elements alone will satisfy your appetite. The menu is divided into Cold and Hot; within the hot, light to heavy dishes.

The Sunomono: To dumb it down-fancy poke. To elevate it- fresh, cooling, and edible flowers. The moonfish is gorgeous and the coolness from the cucumber ironically punches through. 

Tebasaki gyoza: You haven't had chicken wings like this before. The inside is filled with shrimp. I don't know where the croissant is, in the filling or the crumb coat, but either way, stuffed wing like no other. Delicious, light, juicy and crunchy with an element of surprise. The sweet chile sauce seemed like the regular kind, I couldn't tell if it was house-made. 

Ikinari steak: Don't let the size fool you. It is rich and a very heavy dish. Comes out in a sizzling skillet. A huge dollop of miso brown butter, looks like gold and feels as rich, makes the steak outstanding. The skirt steak is cooked to perfection-  medium rare, tender juicy and a delicious char and asian flavor. The caramelized onions and corn really compliment the richness from the butter and sauce. Great fusion. 

Fried Tempura Chocolate Cake: I am not a big fan of the chewiness in mochi, so I went with the extreme opposite: texture bomb! This is a molten chocolate cake fried in tempura batter with dulce de leche sauce, with a side of ice cream, topped with sauteed puffed rice. So you have the ooey goeey, the crispy, crunchy, hot cold, solid and liquid.  Decadent, much? Most definitely. 
In spite of the multiple textures, it felt one note- very sweet. I wish they had some salt or citrus to cut the richness. 

Granted, I have not had enough Japanese food of this kind to compare so I may not be the best judge. I think the food is delicious and of high quality, but I just wasn't wowed by the flavors. It was an elevation of the quality and ingredients of the familiar asian flavors.

They have midday and lunch offerings too which would be great to try out. Prices are comparable, portions depending on the item maybe on the smaller side. 

The service is great. We actually went with the recommendations of our host who told us about the dishes. There is ample seating. 

The reason I was a little annoyed, I picked the wrong premier parking garage downtown (222 parking is the closest to TGP) and by the time I walked over to catch the midday menu, with ten minutes to spare till dinner at 5pm I couldn't order off it. So although the midday is till 5 it isn't. But I agree that's me being pesky. 

Nonetheless, next time. TGP is a great addition to downtown. The upscale Japanese food makes it very unique. And it is a very promising restaurant.",tMkwHmWFUEXrC9ZduonpTg,The Green Pheasant,Nashville,4.0,-86.7731974,36.1598858,"Restaurants, Japanese, Seafood","{'Wednesday': '16:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-22:0', 'Friday': '16:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '16:0-23:0'}",215 1st Ave S,TN
1305,4.0,"The start to our experience here was not great. I called ahead to find out if there was valet at the restaurant in which I was told yes there is. This was great bc we didn't have to pay for uber etc. so when we arrive to the valet stand there is no one in sight and a line of cars parked on the street. Essentially no where legally for us to park to wait for the valet. When we see the valet run up I got out to hand him my keys hoping he knows better than I where we can park our car and he can take it from there. He snaps at us he's swamped and that we need to legally park and to pay a $12 fee for the valet before he can help us. I understand he is working alone on a Saturday night but the attitude was unnecessary. We ended up parking in a garage right down the street and The green pheasant validated it, I feel for the guy but he could have been more pleasant and apologetic. Two people working the stand could probably solve the problem. Then when I arrive my friends I'm meeting are waiting at the bar explained we couldn't be seated until everyone arrived. They'd been waiting at least ten minutes bc of the valet situation and we let the hostess know we are all there and she forgot about us. We reminded her promptly but we didn't feel like we got a warm welcome. Everything was exponentially better once we were seated and welcomed by our waitress Lauren, who goes by L2. She was warm and informative. All the food we ordered was delicious. If I were to rate this place based on the food and Lauren's service alone it would be 5+stars! I definitely would recommend this place to friends but I would tell them either uber or skip the valet all together and park in the garage and have the restaurant validate the parking.

1307,5.0,"Excellent way to spend an hour and a half before a concert in downtown Nashvegas. I'm not ashamed to say that we needed to be schooled on how to read the menu and placing our order. Alex was a pro and recommend the ""crowd pleasers"" as well as his favorites and reasons why. He also asked us to pick two to three things at a time because as soon as the chef prepares each dish, it is brought to the table immediately. Thus, this was the pattern we created. Order eat, order eat, repeat. 

First up was the wedge salad with ginger dressing, fried oysters and the broccolini with bite sized shrimp. Just as we finished these scrumptious plates, we proceed with our next order of spicy crab noodles (be prepared to have a new addiction) and lobster dumplings. As our fork touched the desert plate on the last bite of a caramelized ginger creme brulee, we had come to realize that we experienced something truly special on a simple Tuesday night. From start to finish, The Green Pheasant impresses. Put it on your foodie bucket list pronto.

I personally had the kale caesar and tried someone else's avocado toast. They were both tasty although the toast was slightly burnt.

-Dominic makes one of the best dirty martinis I have ever had...better than capital grille/delfriscos
-Great draft list - always rotating 
-A must go for brunch. We went today and enjoyed a juicy burger and the barones special. Home fries were crispy and the pancake was delicious! That paired with their homemade bloody hit the spot. 

Highly recommend for people to check out, especially if you are as picky as me. I've been to countless spots for brunch / cocktails and this is among the best in philly.

The stuffed long hots were the favorite. They are spicy and stuffed to the max with perfectly cooked sausage. 

The flatbread on the other hand was meh. Its not on your usual flatbread. What i thought was going to be a naan or pita like texture was more like a cracker. It's so thin and the toppings are piled high which made the ""cracker"" soft and soggy. The taste of the veggies needed salt too. 

Last thing we ordered was the beet salad. Slices of tomato, beets, and mozzarella cheese with a balsamic vinegar drizzle. I didn't think i'd he a huge beet fan, but these were good.

The first I came here was for a quick drink to kill time before my reservation at Ralph's (which owns this bar).  The bartender was super informative, even giving us tips on what to order at Ralph's since it was my first time there as well, and the drink I had was delish. 

The second I went was this past Sunday for some food after bike riding. It was still brunch hours-I got the eggs benedict, my boyfriend got their special cheesesteak omelette, and we split the sausage and pepper spring rolls.  First off sausage and peppers is one of my very favorite foods so to see them offered in a unique way was really cool and they were really good. My eggs benedict was good too, but my boyfriends cheesesteak omelette, topped with their homemade wiz sauce, was beyond.  Both brunch entrees were served with spicy potatoes on the side which were tasty too. We had a different bartender this time and he was just as friendly and helpful as the one we had the first time.

I came here with some friends on a Saturday afternoon for brunch, and every element of this restaurant was perfect.  The service was impeccable.  The wait staff were so attentive, my glass was never empty.  We all had these delicious ""Flintstones push pop"" drinks , you must get one!  It is a mimosa with a scoop of sorbet, the ideal brunch drink to wash down all of the great food.  

The food was to die for.  The pickle back wings & waffles dish was my favorite.  The marinade and seasoning of the chicken is one of a kind, combined with the sweetness of the waffles, HELLO flavor explosion!  The avocado toast was also tops. Avocado, egg and Texas toast...perfection.  Another stand out was the Tiramisu French Toast, this is what actual dreams are made of.

I loved the overall ambiance of Bar One.  The art in the restaurant (and in the bathrooms) are really cool.  I wanted to take home one of the pieces hanging in the ladies room!  The music they were playing was awesome, everything from 90s alternative hits to Jay-Z.

We glanced at the menu while we had our drinks and both agreed that we had to come back here. 

Fast forward a few months and we ended up back at Bar One for brunch. It was around 12:30 when we got there and I believe their brunch is 11-2:30 Then the kitchen closes for an hour and they start dinner at 3:30 PM. My girlfriend got Eggs Benedict that she really enjoyed. I ended up getting the cheesesteak omelette with their special wiz sauce on top. I didn't ask how they made their sauce but I suspect it's a mixture of wiz cheese and heavy cream; it was to die for. The entire meal was phenomenal. Their menu is also very eccentric which, as a foodie, I really enjoy. 

The staff is very friendly and informative. They also have a lot of drink specials. If you love Bloody Mary's you'll love it there.

1374,2.0,"I've been on a search for a good, under $20, pasta option for a little while. Bar One isn't it.

     Let's start with what it is, though. Can you go have a beer with your friends, and watch a little of the game? Yes, you definitely can. Do they have a beer list which comparable to other crafty, Philly spots? Yes, definitely. Is it crazy expensive, or crazy crowded? Nope...it's ostensibly a neighborhood bar.

     By no stretch of the imagination is it an Italian restaurant. Frankly, I'm not sure why Bar One even bothers to pretend it is such...perhaps the neighborhood, or proximity to the market...but at any rate, fine Italian cuisine it is not. Excited to try a new spot, stopped in on a brisk Friday in November and, ordered the cavatelli with Gorgonzola sauce and sausage. The most notable issue was that there was no sausage. Strike one. I could not identify the flavor of Gorgonzola in the pale grey sauce either. Let it be know that I love blue cheese, and a little goes a long way with said ingredient; it's a strong flavor. This, however, tasted more like a bland rue. The pasta itself was stuck together in clumps, which made me wonder how it was prepared...pasta doesn't do that in a sauté pan.  It was thoroughly underwhelming. 

    It's also worth mentioning the staff...or at least one bartender.  My gent was fine. He seemed to have a little trouble getting around, but was courteous enough, and managed my order with no issues. There was another, much ruder, gent who spent the evening - or at least the time that I was there - trying to recruit customers into belittling the other bartender (the one serving me). ""Can you believe he has a degree in music?!?!...in MUSIC?"", he asked me with his absurd Thomas Shelby haircut and manicured beard. ""Who does that?!?"", he continued in his effort to impress himself. I absolutely did not take the bait; nor did most of the other customers, in what I can only expect was everyone trying to extend common kindness to a man just trying to do his job. 

     Let's have a reality check here. 1. Publicly belittling others lacks both character and professionalism. Full stop. 2. I have a degree in music, and what has been (so far, thanks be to God) a lasting & rewarding career in the Arts. So, what was meant only as unnecessary posturing between staff members, deeply offended your clientele. I chose not to engage the argument, because that is in no way what I'm looking for in a dinning experience...an argument with an arrogant, yet poorly-informed bartender. The phrase ""service industry"" springs to mind...SERVICE...since we like to repeat ourselves. In conclusion, the food was edible but not good; yet it was the utter pretension of Mr. Shelby which will ensure that I will neither spend another singular dollar, nor recommend Bar One to any of my friends or readers. #Service",QdN72BWoyFypdGJhhI5r7g,Bar One,Philadelphia,4.0,-75.1574465632,39.9398245705,"Cocktail Bars, Bars, Italian, Nightlife, Restaurants","{'Monday': '16:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '16:0-0:0', 'Wednesday': '16:0-0:0', 'Thursday': '12:0-0:0', 'Friday': '12:0-2:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-2:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-0:0'}",767 S 9th St,PA

I wanted to try a new place with great food and service. As always, I read the reviews and pick my spots. So attempting to visit Bar One was not out of the ordinary. Well, as we walked through the festival, we saw a young lady passing out flyers to everyone. To my surprise, as when we got closer, she looked us in our faces, and turned around...mine you, there was no other individuals close to her to pass out the flyers, then us. At this point, I replied that maybe the business that she was representing had an exclusion policy. At that point, an older gentleman standing near her, heard the remark, apologized, and passed us a flyer. 

To my surprise, the flyer was from Bar One! At that point, we continued to walk to the end of the festival, and I was still interested in visiting Bar One. After reaching the end of the festival, we turned around and began to walk back. As we neared the Bar One vicinity, another gentleman was now passing out the flyers. As we approached closer to go near the front of the Bar One, the gentleman did not look at us to give a flyer to either.

The service! Each waiter was extremely attentive and nice, never had to ask for anything as it was already taken care for me.

The drinks were delicious as well! would come to drink rather than eat. 

The bad - the kale calamari salad. The calamari to salad ratio was way off, less calamari, more lettuce. The calamari it self was over salted and heavily coated. 

The Mafaldine pasta - was WAYYY under cooked, I like my pasta al dente but this was still raw. Also the pasta is way too large to have small pieces of shrimp and asparagus with. Again, this dish was over salted.

When I called to make an order for delivery I was frustrated within the first minute, the person who was taking my order sounded like they were high and what should have been a two minute phone order was almost a 10 minute ordeal. Finally got my food and was immediately upset when I opened the box of pizza and instead of green peppers like I asked for, they were red (okay okay its just a difference in color, no biggie) but also the pizza was barely warm. Weird since I only live two blocks away. Then, my boyfriend unwrapped his italian hoagie. We specifically asked for mayo plus sweet peppers and pickles, none of those items were on the sandwich. After a bite he realized instead of genoa salami they used cold pepperoni slices (in what world do italian hoagies come with pepperoni?) At this point we were both fed up so I decides to walk down the street to get my money back. I walk into the establishment, said excuse me to the man working the front counter and asked if I could speak to a manager. Maybe five minutes later a man from the back emerges and doesnt even glance at me for more than a second but proceeds to ask the person behind me what they need. I raised my voice loud enough to be heard and asked if he was the manager and he said yes. I told him the pizza was cold and the food was all wrong and instead of immediately apologizing like you'd think any self respecting manager would he tries arguing with me about my complaints. Finally after about five minutes and multiple stares from the other customers he agree to give me a full refund of my money. Not only was I upset with who ever made the food, but I was even more upset by the way this 'manager' handled the situation.

First of all, everything I've ordered from them has been damn good. I'm not big on pizza and their all-around variety is extensive enough to surprise me each time I look through the menu.

Their delivery guys have always been prompt and courteous.

I read on here that they have difficulty getting people's orders right. I personally don't think that sort of thing should be a surprise; sometimes, a takeout place is going to get your order wrong. More importantly, it's what they do to fix it. On a few occasions my very specific order was improperly interpreted, so I sent them an e-mail.

1. first and foremost the food has to be not just great, but great every time. Check!
2. Price - on par with the competition and even a little higher if its really good. Check!
3. Service - be happy to see me & take my Order; if anything goes wrong or it takes longer then normal - come to me with real empathy and offer apologies and to fix what ever is a-rye. Wow, although really rare - they are experts at caring about you and your meal. Check!

The icing on top of all of this - The Owner is there a lot of the time, the employees have been there for years and years and are happily working where you can watch them = more proof of excellent management - very little turnover, happy workers. 

If an eatery has great food and great service but the price is way over the top no one goes frequently. If you have great prices and great service, but the food sucks - no one goes more then once. Finally if you have great food and great prices but the people there are rude, nasty with poor service never fixing mistakes without an argument - no one goes back.
All 3 categories must always be excellent to get 5 Stars

So the secret to Ardmore Pizza is they are exemplary in all 3 categories all the time - very rare indeed.

Wish they had a sit-down restaurant - oops but then they would need exemplary waiter/waitress staff and a floor manager, dishwashers and so forth - Maybe not, its fine that Ardmore Pizza is known as  The 5 Star Takeout Pizza (and more) eatery of the Main Line.

However, every single time I have come here, they have messed up my order some how. every. single. time.

1538,1.0,"Ardmore Pizza is usually our go-to place for cheesesteaks, burgers, and fries.  The food is consistently good; which is why my experience tonight is so disappointing.

I ordered a large fries and an order of clam strips.  Their fries are usually so amazing that I won't pass them up.  Crispy on the outside, creamy in the middle.  They are french fry heaven.  I'd been thinking of branching out and trying something different, so I ordered the clam strips which were on the appetizer menu.

When I placed the order, the man at the counter asked me if they were the appetizers and I said yes.  He told me he'd ring it up as a platter and that would save me a little money.

And THAT was my mistake.  I should have said, ""no thanks,"" because that platter didn't save me any money at all.

I live a short 5 min from the store.  When I got home, I opened the container to find the fries sitting on top of a salad.  Let's forget that I didn't order salad.  Salads are cold.  French fries are hot.  Dumping hot fries on a cold salad does what to those two foods?  It turns the salad into slimy, limp, warm slop.  It also made their normally crispy fries WET and limp.

As if that weren't bad enough, the clam strips weren't strips. They looked like overcooked little balls and they were all over the fries and the salad.  All of this was in a styrofoam container that was all wet inside from the steam build up.

That entire box was $9.25 + tax of inedible crap and went right in the trash.  

Fine.  Lesson learned.  Next time I want fries, I'll order from the appetizer menu.  And I'll pass on the clam ""strips"" and stick with the two items I know are fantastic: the cheesesteaks and the burgers.

(For the record, I'm not new to ""platters.""  What's different here is the fact that the cold salad was in with hot food. Platters I've ordered elsewhere include salads in their own containers.

Ping pong, small table games, couches, lots of space for standing and sitting, and also weekly trivia and a huge menu of food and beers!

The food was pretty pricey, with a $15 burger coming with a side of chips (which no one at the table ate, the flavor was off or burnt or something). The french fries we ordered were a hit, just wish we asked for more aioli. The hush puppies were huge and came lightly citrus-tasting, which was enjoyable to some, and just alright to others. The burger was perfectly cooked, with delicious cheese and toppings that might make it my favorite burger I've had in a while! But not cheap to eat, as the price doesn't include fries. The chicken sandwich, the same price, was pretty good, but the volume of food doesn't make me want to order again. I really loved the mac and cheese after adding some salt and parmesan.

Farther down, a standard beer bar, bread-making kitchen, and... children's playground? I guess this will appeal to hip young parents. I made the mistake of showing up hungry and ordering a burger and wings. Both were very mediocre for the price. A friend ordered the grilled cheese, which had some kind of onion relish that she didn't appreciate. The beer list was lacking in IPAs and stouts.

The kid area is basically a bar and hodgepodge of kid related things - a large pirate ship playground, some games like skeeball and foosball, some Nintendos, and other stuff like, I guess, Mummers costumes and an old phone booth. First off, the layout is not great -- you can't see most of the play area from the seats and the hidden area is right next to double doors to outside. Also, they just opened and many of the games don't work, are missing their balls, or won't turn on. In addition, the menu is pricy and the drinks and food were underwhelming. For example, we ordered a Bloody Mary, which was $10, and just included Tito's vodka, Bloody Mary mix, and a lemon wedge. It is advertised as coming with Stateside vodka, but whatever.

It was a light crowd in the bar area but had about 3 birthday parties in the center seated area and towards the children's play area.  They have reserved seating and the parties were for children and adults.

The bar area was pretty quiet until about 20 min before the Eagles game.  It became packed with folks ready to celebrate the eagles!  The tv monitors were strategically placed in perfect location and the game was on full audio blast.  So if you're into watching the football game at a bar this is the place.

This place serves brunch so we all had the opportunity to order brunch at the bar as well.  For a large party it's perfect because you don't have to split a bill.  You order at the bar get a number and sit anywhere, they will bring the food to you.  Well, that's great but the food wasn't the best.  Not horrible but nothing to write home about.

1567,3.0,"For the last 9 years I have been dreaming of a comfortable space where you can take your kids to play, have a drink and some food while you relax with friends. So loaded up the family in the minivan and made the pilgrimage to the city and met up with two other of my girlfriends' families. This large industrial building is spacious and has a convenient location in Delaware Avenue and had lots of free parking around.  Outside they had some outdoor seating and a chicken coop, rabbit hutch and a little garden area with tables. 

Inside was ginormous and there were many large tables for big groups available to choose from.  We easily found a table for 8 kids and 6 adults.  The lower level had a play area for the kids and another bar.  There was a play structure to climb on, basketball game, tetherball, some video games (Mario, Kirby, etc), mini skew ball, a telephone booth, picture booth and a broken pinball and  broken shuffleboard table.  The kids area was definitely fun but if you look closely it didn't seem very safe or thought out.  Like the basketball game near the slide opening.  My daughter got nailed in the head.  The metal tether ball on a stage surrounded by concrete seemed a bit sketch.  I was a little anxious letting my kids play there.  

I did not have any beer on this visit but the group's consensus was that the beer was just OK.  We did order fries, pretzel with pimento cheese, the mussels, some pizzas and some collard greens.

Currently, this is the only beer garden in the city that has a dog park so we were really excited to see what it has to offer. When we arrived, the dog park looked pretty crowded so we decided to grab a couple of drinks in the outdoor dining area.

There were other patrons dining outside with their dogs and it was a nice environment except for the occasional loud motorcycles on Columbus Blvd.

My husband placed our drink orders and a dog biscuit through contactless ordering. Our order arrived not long after. The drinks were all right. The dog biscuit was huge, which was great, but it was so hard to break into pieces and chew that we decided against giving it to our pup.

We also noticed many small shards of broken glasses on the ground in the outdoor dining area. A dog could easily have stepped on it and gotten hurt. My husband and the family from a neighboring table picked up the pieces of glass and removed them from the area but I'm very upset about this.

1576,4.0,"So this is going to be one of those places that polarizes people. Especially in this part of town. Some people have to understand what it is Craft Hall is trying to accomplish. This is young family experience during the day, and large group gathering place by night. This type of venue is not always accepted in this zip code. But I'm telling you, this is not a tourist trap and is a genuine establishment. It is also surrounded by some very tough competition with restaurants and bars in Fishtown and NoLibs. I have a pretty high standard when it comes to food and drink and I'm going to say outright that I like everything that is the Craft Hall concept. There is one issue, and that's the pricing of food. Cutting to the chase, here's what to expect:

Before you even get inside, there's one seating area where you can bring a beer or food outside, sit along Delaware ave and hang out next to the chickens and rabbits in their coops (you can't pet them but you can watch them hop around). It's slightly removed from the rest of the establishment but it could be a nice thing to do with kids if the weather is nice. It's quiet and doesn't smell like a chicken coop at all. I love all animals, so I think this is cool.

The Space:
As you walk into the enormous space I notice that it's air-conditioned very well. This was a problem in the space when it used to be Yards brewing. It's an old building, which I believe to be one of the last remnants of the Jack Frost Sugar refinery (someone fact check me?), and it would get uncomfortable at times. But the temperature inside was nice even on a 90 degree day. This converted warehouse is split up between different seating areas. One section has a number of couches to kick back on. Another is filled with high-top tables and a traditional L-shape bar. Towards the back there are low-top tables, a ping pong table, cornhole and a shuffleboard table. In the furthest corner separated from rest of the room is the playground and kids area. Beyond that through a single door on the back wall, is more outside seating that borders but is fenced off from Delaware Ave. I'd like to note that the playground is very separate from the bar area. I wasn't tripping on children while drinking my beer. I was also surprised that the noise level is reasonably quiet and pleasant. Aside from a twenty-something jokingly playing the baby shark song on the communal piano behind me.

The Food and Drink:
So Craft Hall hosts the Mainstay Independent Brewing company started up by former brew masters of Slyfox and the late great Saint Benjamin's Brewing. I'm going to say that if you think their beer is bad, you are just simply wrong. These are some of the best German style beers I've ever tried from an American brewery. And I've tried A LOT. They brew primarily classic German styles. Don't get me wrong, these styles aren't always user-friendly, but they have a great assortment here that should fit anyone's tastes (both hop-lovers and hop-haters) if you learn about what you're ordering. You might just have to ask the bartender a few questions and sample some first. The King Laird Hefeweizen is one of my all-time favorites now and is definite crowd pleaser. The food seems to be New American and comfort foods with some BBQ sprinkled in. They use Lost Bread Company bread for everything, which speaks for itself. The food is excellent and the only reason this place did not receive 5 stars from me is because the food is very expensive for relatively smaller portions. For this reason, I come here all the time now, but for the beer and atmosphere. It's odd to me about the pricing of the food because the beer and cocktails are very reasonable. You can get pitchers of many of their beers for $18. To-go pounder 4 packs are $10. Growlers of their flagships are $13. Why are hush puppies $10 and a tiny asparagus salad $12? I get snacks like the bread board or the pretzels but I usually don't eat a meal here. I love the menu but the pricing is just a little off for an order-and-take-a-number kind of place.  

The Service:
Bartenders were very cool. I talked quite a bit with a few different bartenders and they were all friendly and all knew what they were talking about when it came to food and drink. Like I said before, this place is an order-at-the-counter and grab a number kind of place, so it was nice that they all took time to talk to me despite being busy. 

The Overall:
I really like this place. If they were to adjust their food pricing on some items, I think I would happily update to 5 stars here. I would like this place to succeed, so hopefully this review clears up some misconceptions of the place. Comfortable seating, great beer, fun games, cool bartenders, decent food. Bonus points for chickens.

1) The menu is insanely expensive. Our sandwiches were pretty basic and came with zero sides--on average, a sandwich costs $15. I should have just ordered off the kids menu which at least includes fries. 

2) Tables by the play area are only high tops. This means the chairs are too high for small children to comfortably and safely sit. Babies in high chairs look absurd as they are so low compared to the adults and thus don't have any table surface for eating. 

3) Service needs help. The waitress wasn't familiar with the menu and then messed up my order.

Our kids had a ball and we were able to enjoy ourselves without worrying if we were being nuisance to surrounding guest. Our food orders were brought up promptly and the quality was great! It was walk up to the bar service and everyone was very friendly. Parking could be slightly sparse but I noticed a lot of families ubered or walked from neighboring neighborhoods. They also had a small I've recommend this brewery to friends traveling with kids because it's rare to have somewhere so accommodating to families.

This place has a huge indoor pirate ship structure that our 6 and 4 year old loved- they happily kept themselves occupied for a hour or two while we sat and relaxed and had some cocktails! We noticed a ton of play dates happening with other groups and will do this in the future with our friends! 
The menu was select albeit a bit pricey for bar bites, but the food was good- they did a nice brunch selection though!! There are TVs over the bars that you can catch the sporting events- I got to check the score of the US Open while I waited for our drinks this summer! There is a section with a foosball table and corn hole and another area for old Skool Nintendo games- a couple of the controllers were faulty but neat concept nonetheless- behind the pirate ship there are mini rock climbing walls that are perfectly kid sized- the irony is that we spent money at the Real Rock Wall next door only to have them go as high as the wall here!

We opted for the pork poutines and the pork shoulder bbq platter. The poutines were actually quite delicious. The gravy was creamy with loaded with flavor. The pork shoulder platter was delicious as well. The pork was juicy and tender and came with a side of coleslaw, pickled beets and onions, and two slices of Lost Bread Co.

The bread was really good! It was buttery and you can actually taste the milk in it (creamy). Highly recommend if you are a beer fan!

1592,4.0,"Craft Hall is really interesting. It's a gigantic, family-friendly brewery with a pretty complex restaurant concept. All of the bread and desserts are baked onsite via Lost Bread Co. The menu features a lot of great snacks and sandwiches, though not many healthy options. I've tried the cheese curds, wings, fries and italian market panini. All were absolutely delicious!  

The beverages menu offers a lot to drinkers but not much for non-drinkers. I've personally tried their ginger beer, which is on tap (it's great!) and virgin bloody marys (their mix is made in-house and it's delicious!). I'd really love to see some creative NA cocktails, though! For the drinkers, there's a ton of beer, plus some wines, hard seltzers and cocktails. Only a few of the cocktails are made with local spirits (shout out to Philadelphia Distilling and Manatawny Still Works) and it would be cool to see more Philly representation on that list. 

For someone like me, aka, not a kid person, Craft Hall is kind of a hard sell. This place was without a doubt made for families. It's truly a genius concept! On my two visits (so far), there were multiple children's birthday parties. That said, the space is so large that even adults-only groups can likely find some kid-free space near the front bar.

A few problems.  First, the beer wasn't very good (didn't have any food) and until they refine their brewing, they need to offer at least a few other local brewers' offerings.  Second, somebody is going to get hurt.  There is just too much glassware and areas where kids can fall (adults were not even honoring the no glassware on the pirate ship sign).  It really is just a matter of time.  As another parent put it, ""this is my nightmare.""  Third, many of the older kids (6-8) ran amok unsupervised creating problems for younger kids (for a while older kids took over the slide by only going up the slide...).

I went yesterday with a group of people, it was the first gorgeous day so I was looking all over for places that were dog friendly so we could sit outside with our pup. On the website it says verbatim:

""Q: CAN I BRING MY DOGGO??

A: Your pup is more than welcome to join you for a pint but they'll need to stay in the outside seating area. Only service doggos are allowed inside.""

I called numerous times to double check but the phone number sends you right to a voicemail box. Regardless I figured since the website explicitly says dogs are allowed we should be okay. So we load everyone up in the car and take the 25 minute drive. When we arrive I go inside first to see how to get to the outdoor area without going through the bar because of the dog. The bouncer asks me if it's a service dog and I said ""no"" and he told me dogs aren't allowed. I explained to him what the website said and how we were just going to sit outside and he tells me ""this is a people establishment"". It was veryyyy frustrating. I understand dogs not being allowed inside and I even understand restaurants and breweries not being dog friendly, but maybe if you're NOT dog friendly, don't say on your website that you are ... anyway so I had to leave everyone there, drive my pup back home the 25 minutes then turn around and come right back.

After looking around for a minute, we noticed the kids play area, which is mostly why we decided to come here. Upon further investigation, we realized it was more suited for older kids, but it was still a good mix of things. Climbing structures, slides, a pirate ship, games and swings. 

We walked over to the bar and ordered some food. I got the BBQ wings and a cheeseburger, the wife got a tuna melt and we got the kiddo a burger. We walked around the play area a bit while we waited, and in probably 15 min or so, the food was already at our table. 

I'm jumping right into the food here because we all know that's the most important part. The wings were good. Really good. Super crispy, hot and with just a little sauce, the way I love them. The French fries that came with the kid's burger were also hot and crispy with just enough salt. If we had just gotten those 2 things, this place would have been an easy 5 stars, but that was not the case. 

The burgers were very well done, thin, unseasoned and were most definitely frozen prior to our arrival. Sorry, but throwing on a bunch of lettuce, a LOT of mayo and 5 pickles, PLUS a pickle on the side, does not mask the taste of a hockey puck. Also, the pickles are bread and butter pickles I believe. No one likes those. My wife, who loves pickles, actually spit hers out. Later after we had finished eating, I also saw a man at another table spit a chunk of his pickle out as well. It was a sad day for pickles. 

The tuna melt, which my wife barely touched was not great either. The tuna, even though it was flavorful, was cold, the bread was soggy and someone just threw on a piece of cheese, put the whole thing under the broiler for a second and by the time it reached the table, the cheese was already room temperature. There was also a lot of relish on top of the whole thing, which made it prettier, but didn't help overall.

My friend didn't even realize I went and got us another round of drinks by the time I got back to the table. We ordered a margarita pizza and it was delicious. There are three different sizes of beer you can get 10oz/16oz and pitcher and are priced accordingly and reasonably. There are both dark and light craft brews, as well as some liquor drinks. Craft hall has a playground for kids, and various games for adults. What really set this place apart was I left my purse on the table and got distracted by everything that was going on at the event. When I got back to the table the staff had moved my purse for safe keeping, and everyone was aware when I walked back up. Multiple employees let me know where my purse was and that they moved it for it to be safe. Something you don't see everywhere, and something that is most definitely appreciated.

1608,2.0,"Service was good, but the food was not.

As other reviewers have said, the burgers are not good here. I usually go for a mushroom burger but instead opted for their guacamole bacon burger. It's served on an onion ciabatta roll which did not add anything to the burger except for an overly hard texture, especially when paired with the dry burger patty. The guacamole could have used some more seasoning and the thick-cut bacon was okay. 

The fries that came with the burger were salty and soggy; my husband commented that they were likely old. There was a good amount of other customers in the restaurant , so I'm not really sure why there would be old fries unless they cooked huge batches of them in advance (maybe to keep up with their promise of ""endless french fried potatoes""?). The sweet potato chips we had as an app were fresh and also a favorite with my family, so I'd suggest getting the chips instead of the fries. 

From the prices on the menu (around $9 for burgers), you'd think that the food would be good or at least a notch higher than ""decent"". Not so at Cheeseburger in Paradise.

P.S. I had to change a diaper while there and the changing table was inside the handicapped stall. The door on the stall must have been installed improperly because the latch was on the outside of the stall and didn't actually lock. The sink counters were also completely wet.

The cheese didn't appear melted nor was the burger hot, warm was even a stretch.  Good fries though.  My wife had the fish sandwich.

1615,3.0,"My son had a good three word review for this place, when he misread the name on the menu. 

Cheeseburgers and Parasites 


Actually it wasn't that bad, but it wasn't great either. The problem for me, was that if a particular food item is displayed in your restraunts name, it better be damn good. These burgers weren't paradise, they were simply average. They have some decent burger toppings ( I myself got a bleu cheese and onion straw burger, which was decent but not wow) but I was surprised to see that the CheeseBurger in Paradise burger was simply a cheeseburger...served with a pickle. 
To go along with that, the fries were blah, McDonald's shoestring sized yet not even as crispy, laying somewhat limp on the plate. I prefer steak fries, I like girth ( ...that's what she said!) 

Upon being sat, the song "" Cheeseburger in Paradise"" by Jimmy Buffett, was playing over their stereo system. I had a brief but rational worry that this song would be played on a loop as I ate. Thankfully, it wasn't nor were we subjected to JBs entire catalog but the CIP song was peppered liberally in the song rotation , so that we heard it at least 3 times while dining. 

The tikibar decor was cool but not terribly impressive. The service was very good, although it was pretty dead even for a Monday night. My son loved the paper umbrella that came with his kids drink and I could tell that his older sister, who proudly orders drinks and entrees off the regular menu, was seething in jealousy yet too proud with her ""adult"" status to ask for one.. 

I didn't use the facilities but both offspring reported that they were ""freaked out"" by the peeping fish placed strategically in the bathrooms. We didn't get dessert but their Chocolate Nachos sounded intriguing , until I saw the faces of a couple nearby, who got the dish. It didn't look pretty. 

Overall, it was an average experience. I would not go out of my way to either return to CIP or to avoid it. When there are so many places to choose from, CIP needs to distinguish itself from all the other restraunt chains. My advice would be to ""beef"" up those titular average burgers and to get those rude fish out of the bathrooms, that like to watch people make toilet.",2xVsWBNFwZOxIOdd9Mwnww,Cheeseburger In Paradise,Exton,2.5,-75.630607,40.029962,"Restaurants, Burgers",,116 N Pottstown Pike,PA

1625,3.0,"Driving through the West Chester area on a lazy sunny afternoon, I made an early dinner stop at Cheeseburger In Paradise in Exton, a Jimmy Buffett theme restaurant and bar. I like the very laid back and relaxed atmosphere here. The inside of the place is decorated like a tropical beach house with a straw roof bar area, surf boards, and painted fish and palm tree murals. Background music with rock music and Buffett tunes resonates throughout the place. There are colorful wooden patio chairs and there's outside seating with flaming lamps and a spectacular view of the traffic out on Pottstown Pike and the Kmart across the road. 

I sat up at the bar so I could watch the sports highlights on the TV. There are several beers on tap including Landshark, Miller Lite, Coors Light, Sam Adams, and Yuengling Lager. On Monday nights, it's Raingutter Regatta when there are drink specials on Landshark Lager. Since I still had a long drive left, I went nonalcohic and ordered a very fruity pomegranate soda. I went over the menu which offers beach fare including appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, bbq ribs, coconut shrimp, fish tacos, and desserts. Turkey and veggie burger options available at no additional cost.

I did not order a cheeseburger, but I went for the Fish Tacos ($10.99), 3 of them served with island rice. The fish tacos were stuffed grilled flour tortillas (soft and crispy) with spicy grilled fish, cabbage, and pineapple salsa, served with a tangy orange dressing on the side. The rice was lacking flavors, but otherwise a healthier accompaniment than fries. The service at the bar was laid back. My order was taken, the food brought out in acceptable time, and I was left alone to enjoy the food and the fruity soda.

These chain restaurants must all have the same consulting company because they all have the same routine going on.  Elaborate theme oriented exterior that tries to be ""fun"", brightly colored laminated menus, ridiculous themed interiors, nearly identical websites, signature appetizers, and terrible food.  

Jimmy Buffet's foray (cash  grab) into the restaurant racket boasts cheeseburgers.  They are not bad, but in the end the industrial nature of the restaurant cancels out the positives.  My burger was juicy and cooked as I requested but did not come with what the menu said it would come with: jalapenos, sour cream, and pepper jack cheese.  Instead I received some sort of chemically altered dairy slab, No sour cream, and pickles.  

The food was just not discussion worthy.  

Our server must  have been playing hide  and seek.  Annoying.

The interior is pathetic for all but individuals below the age of 20.  The bar has a fake straw roof to give the impression you are on the beach.  Only you never feel like you are on the beach.

Their red sauce is really good. Its sweet which really hits my sweet teeth. Thats right, plural. 

The house dressing is awesome, again, kind of sweet. The complimentary bread is really a decent piece of bread and not some cheap roll. They are really good at bringing you more to wipe up that dressing!

1647,4.0,"This is definitely one of the best places to eat in Alton. My family and I used to go here pretty much exclusively for our special occasion meals, and it's a great place for dates; in fact, you'll probably see a good number of high school students there around homecoming and prom, since Alton High and Marquette Catholic are close by. So it's a busy place, especially on weekends, but I've never had to wait very long for a table - plus, since it's a small town, chances are you'll run into someone you know, and the wait won't seem as long either way. 

I can't speak to their whole menu, as I only ever ordered two items when dining there: the toasted ravioli, and the peppercorn steak. Now, toasted ravioli is touted as a St. Louis original, and indeed it's something I've yet to find outside of that little circle of the Midwest. It's not very fancy, but it *is* good: well-seasoned beef ravioli, breaded and fried, with marinara sauce on the side for dip. It's technically an appetizer, but I'm one of those people who eat lots of little meals, so it was always enough for me. 

The peppercorn steak, on the other hand, is where this place really shines. A tender filet mignon, perfectly seasoned and served medium rare with a hint of butter and herb - this is the steak that got me into eating steak. It practically melts on your tongue, try though you might to savour every last ounce of flavour. 

I wanted to give this place five stars, since relative to the other options in Alton, it definitely deserves them. I'm still convinced that the steak alone is worth five stars. I only gave it four, though, because as much as I love this place, there *is* better food out there.

1652,3.0,"So....I want to be fair to Tony's but I also know that I'll be back regardless if I want to be or not.  They have a nice bar and the food is decent.  The danger of sitting in the restaurant part is that you could be seated in a really weird room totally isolated from the rest of society.  Knowing this, we asked to be seated in the bar area where the atmosphere is more casual.

The waitresses were not busy and liked to avoid eye contact.  They were supernice when we were getting tables together but when it was time to order, it was like our waitress forgot that she was a waitress.  We ordered a meatball sandwich and the menu listed that you could order it as either sliced or whole, so I ordered it sliced.  Her response was, ""Uhh...what?  No one has ever asked me that before.  Let me ask the kitchen if they can do that.""  Listen lady, not only is it on the menu but all you do is take a knife and slice through that sucker like you're cutting a tomato.

We also ordered some unhealthy appetizers, I liked the toasted ravioli.  Garlic bread was huge and cheesy and meh.  I mean, everything was fine.  We wanted to order from the restaurant menu but they made a change recently that you had to order from the bar menu which limited our choices.

At the end of the meal, I gave her my credit card and asked for an itemized receipt after the fact.  The waitress said, ""Umm...I THINK I should be able to do that.""  Listen lady, you already DID do that because you ran my credit card.  I don't know what you did with it.  I admit, it's a bad habit I have from Singapore but I tell you, Singaporean waiters are shit at taking orders and mischarge you half of the time.

I digress.  Anyway, Tony's martinis are really good.  Don't order the special drink chamboise.  It's disgusting and its chalkboard advertisement should be wiped clean immediately.

Over the years this is the place that my family would always go when we got together in Alton. Over the last several months I have been in town quite a bit and have been to Tony's no less than six times in two months. However, every time I go I feel worse about the decision. While the pepperloins are still top-notch I cannot say the same about other items on the menu. The veal is pre-breaded frozen patties and tasted like it was over-cooked after being freezer burned. The spaghetti was cold and over-cooked. The pizza used to be the best anywhere around. For some reason they have changed the crust and now is just so-so. The staff, while usually friendly, are inexperienced and in 6 trips in two months we have never seen the same waiters. Not sure why there seems to be such turnover, but this prevents them from knowing the basics, such as what brands of alcohol are available.

Perhaps the biggest shock here is the recent attempt of Tony's to change the menu format. The create your own pizza/pasta gimmick is not the tradition that I have come to love from this restaurant.

1682,4.0,"A group of cousins gathered here for our Christmas celebration and had a blast. 
How could we not have fun, when we had 30 draft beers to choice from and some of the best pizza in the Bi-State area. We were in the bar area which is referred to as Tony's Third Street Cafe. The bar has a more casual and relaxed dining atmosphere and the wait staff makes your experience fun. 

There were three couples and a single in attendance and everyone raved about their food. Alex the single diner, ordered the Cheeseburger pizza and had them hold the mustard.  It was so tasty, it actually tasted like a big meaty burger. I may have to order that one on our next visit to Tony's. I didn't pay close enough attention to what the other couples ordered, but I can tell you what we had; Onion Rings, Large Caesar Salad and Tony's Special Deluxe Pizza. 

The onion rings were big thick slices and evenly breaded. I can see these being a perfect accompaniment to a ""real"" cheeseburger. Our large Caesar was definitely enough for two to share, or it could be a ""meal"" for a person watching the weight. 
I enjoyed the salad, but for my personal taste I like my Caesar dressing to have more of an anchovy bite to it. 

Our pizza was flawless! Tony's offers two types of crust; thin and thick and they should not be confused with the traditional types. Tony's thin crust is more like a flat bread and his thick is the bastard child of traditional and thin crust pizza. What that means is; the crust of the pie part is more like a traditional thin and the edges is like a traditional hand tossed pizza. I wish other pizza parlors offered this type of crust, because it gives you the best of both. 

Another thing that makes Tony's pizza stand out from others, is his sauce. As stated by James M. it has a little ""sweet"" twang to it. When it is combined with all the toppings on my Special Deluxe it made things pop. That sweet sauce covered in meats, onions, green pepper and black olives was a true heavenly delight.  If a picture paints a thousand words, the one I posted of my pizza is worth thousand calories. 

Our server was a blast, she knew it was a holiday celebration (gift exchanging made it obvious) and she made sure we were well taken care of.

I have been going to Tony's since I was a baby, literally. This used to be the nicest restaurant in Alton, IL, but that is not the case anymore.

I have had two awful experiences there within the last few months, and I don't see how I can support this establishment anymore. The first bad experience was a mess from the beginning and ended with me waiting over 30 minutes to get my bill because ""the computer was down."" To compensate me for my $40 bill the manager sent me a $10 gift card (thanks you cheap skate), which I gave to my parents because I was so disgusted by the service that I had no desire to go back.

Just a couple days ago my best friend was begging me to go out to eat with her and I agreed, and she chose Tony's. Great. I started off by ordering a Mojito, which is considered one of the most popular cocktails in America. According to this website it's #1...

http://www.themost10.com/10-most-popular-cocktail-drinks/

Anyways I digress. They couldn't make me a mojito for some reason so I ordered a Moscow Mule.  The waiter first asks me what is in a Moscow Mule (ginger beer + Vodka). So I made sure they had a ginger beer and explained how easy it was to make. Apparently the Moscow Mule is too difficult for the precious bartender to make. Although they had ginger beer and they clearly have vodka they refused to make me one stating that ""they didn't know how to ring it in.""

1701,2.0,"NOTE: I wrote this review a couple months ago, and like an idiot, posted it to the wrong Tony's restaurant. So the menu item reviewed may or may not have the same impossible qualities today. 

This is where I received what will forever be known as ""the physically impossible sandwich""... and it sucked. 

I ordered the meatball sandwich, just looking for something simple that's impossible to screw up. How can you screw up a meatball sandwich? Well, these knuckleheads found a way. 

On the plate placed before my lay two large meatballs, a bowl of sauce and two two-inch thick slabs of bread... OK, so what the bejesus am I supposed to do with this? There was no sandwich, but materials to assemble a sandwich... but that would be impossible. If I assembled said sandwich, the sandwich would be like 5 or 6 inches thick. 

My wife suggested cutting the meatballs into quarters to reduce the potential disaster ratios that lay before me... Didn't work. Still two thick for any human without a disjointed jaw. Hmmmm... Maybe open faced?... no, too messy and the meat to bread ratio was still off... Maybe try to cut the bread length wise? Now we're just getting silly.

So, after 10 or 15 minutes of trying to figure out how to eat the $9 sandwich that wasn't even a sandwich, I came to grips with the fact that the reason my non-sandwich sandwich was not served to me as a sandwich was because it was physically impossible.

How do we even define what a sandwich is? ... I'm not going there. 

So, I ate the ingredients separately - and it was mediocre at best. Worst was the bread. Incredibly bland and dry. I commented to my wife that it could make decent home insulation material. 

My wife had lasagna and suspected it had been frozen and microwaved.

All said and done, our bill was like $40... for two pieces of bread, two meatballs, two beers, and microwave lasagna.

And that's not with the labor and frustration of me contemplating ""the physically impossible sandwich.",ljxNT9p0y7YMPx0fcNBGig,Tony's Restaurant & 3rd Street Cafe,Alton,3.0,-90.1862032987,38.896563,"Restaurants, Specialty Food, Steakhouses, Food, Italian, Pizza, Pasta Shops","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '16:0-21:30', 'Wednesday': '16:0-21:30', 'Thursday': '16:0-21:30', 'Friday': '16:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '16:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '16:0-21:30'}",312 Piasa St,IL

1704,2.0,"Let's consider this restaurant to be a cup of black tea, and... I'm not a fan of BLACK TEA... So really this place AIN'T MY CUP OF TEA. 

Tony's has heavily dated decor and a cigar soiled smell that was completely unappetizing... Perhaps they should bottle up the smell and sell it to those trying to lose weight? 

The food was below average too, only further putting the kibosh on my appetite. I ordered the salmon with a double side of vegetables and a salad. The salad was 100% iceburg lettuce, which is fine because I love the crunch-factor... But I was so very disappointed with my entree, no crunchy iceburg could make up for it. The salmon was HORRIBLY COOKED and I could tell they simply took a pre-frozen piece of fish from an individually sealed package, threw it on a griddle and called it good to go. When it arrived in front of me, I was heavily disappointed to see a HUGE FISH COOKING FAUX-PAS.... The salmon albumin all over my plate! I would have also been disappointed by the tiny serving ($17.99 a plate) but I could certainly not stomach more than what was given to me. 

As for the other dishes, I heard nothing but NEGATIVE comments (one dining companion even imitated what Gordon Ramsey from Kitchen Nightmares might say, it was hilarious but ANYTHING BUT complimentary), aside from the RAVIOLI apparently being fantastic, but if that's the only item that's good on this huge menu, it's definitely not worth trying out. 

The reason for the 2 star rating is because I came to this restaurant with a party of 15, half under the age of ten, and we only had ONE SERVER who never once got flustered or annoyed by our crazy commotion!

We went for dinner on the recommendation of a friend.  It was a Friday evening and we didn't have reservations so I was prepared for a wait. I was shocked when the host said it would only be 10-15 minutes. My husband and I stood up front for a few minutes until another hostess asked us to wait at the bar ""at the end of the hall"". 

We strolled down the hallway past a good number of banquet rooms and finally found the bar through an old swinging door. We stood waiting for about 10 minutes and finally decided to have a glass of wine.  The wine list is mediocre at best.  My husband went to the bar to order and the bartender had no idea which wine on the list he requested.  The bartender's quote was ""all I know about wine is red or white"". A waiter finally showed him where the bottles were.  After another 15 minutes, we wandered back up front to check on our table.  The host remembered us and said we were next.  We were seated in a cavernous booth after about a 35 minute wait.  

Our waiter came over and seemed immediately disappointed that we already had drinks.  He walked away and came back 15 minutes later to take our orders. I requested a glass of water at that point.  We both ordered pasta entrees and salads.  I got my water pretty quickly and our entrees were close behind.  We then asked about our salads that we hadn't received.  The waiter appeared pretty embarrassed and proceeded to tell us that he was so busy he was sweating and that if we wanted drinks to order now because the table next to us had been waiting about 20 minutes for another round of beers.

The food itself was okay. It was filling and the portions were well-sized, but not something worth a trip back over to Alton.

Order stuffed mushrooms that tasted freezer burned and pepperloin and pizza. Pizza sauce was sweeter than Chuckee Cheeses disgusting. And pepperloin was as dry as sawdust even with garlic butter. I am done with this place never again. Only went cause I was reliving the old days asking myself it couldn't have changed that much....YES it can and has. This place has gone so far downhill it's not even funny. We ordered stuffed mushrooms which were good. I ordered a $35 pepperloin with white pasta and my husband ordered bacon artichoke white pasta.  Well folks it was disgusting!!!  With a capital D. The white pasta tastes like pasta and if my husband didn't have bacon in his it would have had no taste what so ever. I got the 12 oz pepperloin medium with garlic butter. When I got this $35 steak it was well done no garlic butter and no peppercorns. So I cut into it two times thinking maybe I am missing the pink somewhere... nope well done and the edges were saw dust. Sent it back the waitress brings back the same steak smothered in butter.  R u kidding me!!  How do u make a $35 well done steak go back to medium with butter??  They r ignorant and the food is worse  save your money and go to Max's time out.

Yesterday took a friend and her children to Tony's after apple picking.  When we arrived we were told our wait would be 20 min.  At 30 min I asked how much longer.  We were finally taken to our table 45 min after we arrived.

While waiting for our table in the small entry way, we noticed multiple occasions where the hostess desk was left unattended for 5-10 min at a time.  During these times the small entry area filled up with patrons waiting to be welcomed.

When we finally reached our table our waiter came by within a few minutes, took our drink order (all water) and 10 min later they arrived.  At that point the waiter left our table to take care of other tables.  In his absence another wait person came by and told us about the evenings specials and said our waiter would be with us soon that he was running behind. Another 5-10 mins later the second wait person returned and said they would be taking care of our table.  They took our order and after it was requested, brought bread.

We ordered an appetizer of Fried Artichoke Hearts.  Rather than receiving the entire heart, we received overly fried artichoke heart quarters.  Pathetic....not nearly worth the $8 we were charged.

When the food arrived it was disappointing.  The kids food was acceptable.  They had a burger and salad.  My friend had the Teriaki Chicken Kabob and I had the Garlic Chicken.  When my friends dish arrived all that was on the plate was the kabob....no side, no garnish, no nothing.  Definitely not restaurant quality presentation. She commented the taste was ok, but nothing special or worth the long wait.  My garlic chicken was advertised as being pungent, which to my mind meant you'd really taste the garlic.  Not so.  A tasteless, almost overflowing amount of chicken and pasta was served in a bowl that was too small for the portion.  The dish was supposed to have onions, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, chicken and garlic over linguine pasta.  I got lots of pasta, plenty of mushrooms, scarce amounts of onions, tomatoes and artichoke hearts.  There was some garlic  but not anywhere near pungent. They also served a slice of garlic bread that was so hard it was inedible.  I was totally disappointed in this meal.

Due to the extremely long wait time for a table, the mediocre service, the poor food quality and the general lack of hospitality I will not be returning to Tony's.

Best place to sit in Tony's is in the bar area...smaller menu, smaller portions but just as good and much more casual.  It's kind of our go-to when we are out without the kiddos.  I will say, I've never felt comfortable taking my very well-behaved 3 year old there.

1729,2.0,"I ventured across the river today and made my way to an old favorite I hadn't been to in years. They recently changed buildings and I was excited to see the new place. I was seated in the bar area which I don't particularly enjoy due to noise and foot traffic. I ordered a 12oz filet, I wanted the 8oz, but it was only $3 cheaper. I ordered it cooked medium with Oscar topping and steak fries. The house salad was bigger than I remembered with the same sweet salad dressing I love. The steak took awhile to come out. It was cold and cooked rare. The ""Oscar topping"" was an uncooked crab cake with three dried up pieces of asparagus thinner than a green bean. I only ate about half the steak. There were only about 12 fries on the tiny plate. They were served burning hot. It took about 10minutes for them to cool down and by that time I had lost my appetite. I ended up eating snacks in the car on the way home.

I honestly could eat them as the meal they are so good.  Draft pints were on special for $2 each so I of course had a few to along with my meal.

For the main course, my wife and I ordered a pizza with pepperoni and italian sausage.  This was my first time ordering a pizza at Tony's and I was impressed.

The service was good and the prices were great.
