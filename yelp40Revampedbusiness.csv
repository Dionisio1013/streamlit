7,4.0,"El ""Dragon Chino"" o ""China Dragon"" es un pequeño restaurante con gran sabor.
Siendo un restaurante de familia, ""China Dragon"" ha estado presente por 24 años, (como nos mencionó el dueño) ayer en la tarde que buscábamos comida China de calidad, el lugar es cálido y los empleados son amables, atentos y rápidos.

Ahora, a la comida; es bastante difícil encontrar comida china que no sea muy grasosa, salada o parezca que haya estado en un contenedor todo el día, en China Dragon ordenamos una orden de arroz frito con vegetales, 2 rollitos fritos y una orden de carne estilo mongol, con esto recibimos gratis una orden de frituras con cangrejo y arroz blanco (noto que esto fué para llevar).

En resumen, la comida es muy recomendable, y volvería a ""China Dragon"" cualquier dia si hay antojo de comida China a buen precio y gran atmósfera.


""Chinese Dragon"" is a small restaurant with great food. Being a family-owned restaurant for 24 years (as the owner mentioned) we checked it out yesterday night for some fast Chinese food, however we noticed as soon we got there that the place was cozy and employees are nice, attentive and fast.

Now for food; it is difficult to find food in a Chinese restaurant that is not super greasy, salty or looks like it's been sitting in a container all day. At China Dragon, we ordered fried rice, 2 vegetable rolls and Mongolian style beef (It was very very good). With the order we also received a side of white rice, and crab puffs. (Note we took this order to go).

So after looking around and finding no wait staff, we decided to go seat ourselves. After about 3 minutes we were greeted by a waitress. 

The restrooms were not clean. This should've been the first red flag. The doors, light switches and anywhere people touch were caked with dark brown grease/dirt and there were no paper towels available either. This made me wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen. 

My wife ordered the cashew chicken and the Mongolian beef for me. The mongo beef was good with green and white onions and a good sauce. The cashew chicken looked and tasted bad. The veggies appeared to have been canned and the the sauce was milky white colored. The chicken was breaded and soggy. Definitely stay away from their cashew/almond chicken if you decide to come here. 

The egg rolls that came with the lunch special were freshly made but a little hard and weird tasting. The fried rice was good. The service was okay. The wait staff was friendly but not very interested in checking up on us. Had to wave them down for things.

30,3.0,"I enjoy the vast selection of healthy food options at Caviar & Bananas. The atmosphere feels very L.A. The white and black decor is perfect. What I don't appreciate is the parking situation. My first time parking in the deck, I thought that I would get an hour free. I grabbed the ticket from the station and parked (it's very narrow and cramped FYI) on the 3rd floor. The parking spaces are not generous nor are the compact spaces truly *compact.* So, whomever your parking company is, however closely affiliated, there should be better customer service reps available to communicate that you HAVE TO VALIDATE your parking. Clear signage would be much appreciated. I'm a pretty observant person and there may have been one sign anywhere in the vicinity. Most places simply note that you've selected an hour and you don't have to reenter the ticket or it notes your ""in and out"" times and doesn't charge you for less than an hour. This is a fault that is easy to fix. Also, the attendant was less than friendly when I told him it was my first time parking there and if he could make this one exception since the place was right there - he said ""Nope. Nothing I can do"" and just waited for one of us, my co-worked or myself to pay $3.00 when we were there for 45 minutes. It wouldn't read my card w/ a chip but did read hers which also had a chip. Attendants shouldn't be rude or unhelpful. 

Therefore, in busy places like Nashville, you are only as good as your parking. That gets more people to you on a regular basis and also return customers. If it is difficult to get to you - then you'll suffer. Regardless, this business will most likely flourish but the parking company may get replaced. I'll be back, but I doubt when I have to park there.",lk9IwjZXqUMqqOhM774DtQ,Caviar & Bananas,Nashville,3.5,-86.7988947,36.1483712,"Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Wine Bars, Bars, Nightlife, American (Traditional), Event Planning & Services, Food, Caterers, Breakfast & Brunch, Cafes, Diners","{'Monday': '7:0-17:0', 'Tuesday': '7:0-17:0', 'Wednesday': '7:0-17:0', 'Thursday': '7:0-17:0', 'Friday': '7:0-17:0', 'Saturday': '7:0-17:0', 'Sunday': '7:0-17:0'}",2031 Broadway,TN

34,3.0,"I was invited for the soft opening for the restaurant over the weekend, so that needs to be taken into great consideration for this review.

The space: beautiful, clean, bright....very Dean & Deluca'esque. Everything is order at the counter(s) - salad bar, sandwich & soup bar, prepared foods bar and then an open air market throughout.
The prices: it's not cheap ($10+ for brunch entrees, mimosa carafe $22)
The service: Not fair to comment, since it was the soft opening...it was exactly where it should've been for a soft opening.
The food: errrrr, I had the B.E.L.T. and my counterpart had the chicken and waffle biscuit. I felt like I wanted more to mine (more egg? more arugula? more balance?) the best part was the toasted sourdough. The biscuit...It's huge - as in, big gulp huge. I regret saying, it was a bit dry and seemed to be more on display and less tasty, but I digress, how do you eat something that big anyways.

Grits were delish, but lacked any jalapeño spice and the potatoes were actually very good, crispy and all.
Another friend had flattering things to say about the breakfast burrito as well. It was all....good.

Also, to be clear, this was a soft opening, so I think there are always things to iron out, however, this is not their first rodeo. I don't think I would personally return (I'm cheap), however, the space itself is worth a look and if you need a brunch place in this area for parents or out-of-towners it is dressed to impress, I have no doubt they'll do well.

36,4.0,"Make your own salad or choose from one of theirs on the menu? Make your own sandwich or choose from one of theirs on the menu? Make your own plate of food from various pre-made options like you're at Whole Foods (or Central Market, for my Texas friends - geez, I miss Central Market and HEB. Sorry, sidetracked)? Something for everyone. Healthy eaters? Options. Picky eaters? Options. 

I decided against their tasty sounding salads and sandwiches to try some of the pre-made options. I got some simply baked salmon, some kale salad, and some pesto grilled peaches. All of it was pretty good. They also have lots of options for snacks, drinks, desserts, etc. 

You go order what you want, they give you a ticket (or tickets if you go to two different lines or if you're paying for more than one person), and then they ring you up at the registers closer to the entrance. 

They also serve breakfast (I'll be back), and have a bar where you can order beer, wine, or coffee. (I got a cappuccino to go - very good.) 

C&B is another new Nashville spot that is trying really hard to be cool. High, high ceilings, white paint everywhere, so bright and airy you feel like you're in an aviary. Chairs that are beautiful but WILL leave a gorgeous geometric pattern in your legs and butt. I don't mind this as long as 1) the food is actually good, and 2) the prices aren't quadruple what they should be because you're paying for the decor. C&B isn't cheap. But overall, I liked the experience and the food.

Parking is rough, but there's a garage for the building just to the right of the entrance to C&B, and they validate for 1 hour (possibly during certain hours only, so I'd check that). I stayed for longer than an hour, so I paid $3 when I left the garage.

40,4.0,"After seeing some seriously beautiful interior photos from Eater and Yelp, I was waiting for the right opportunity to give Caviar & Bananas a shot, and was happy I decided to come in on a Sunday for brunch. 
It was extremely hot outside and we made the mistake of walking here from our condo (not my smartest idea). So were were both miserable when we came in (bless you air conditioning). The restaurant is split up into cold items and lunch foods and warmer meals and coffee on the other side. Of course for brunch the coffee/hot food was the busiest and had a long line (though nothing compared to Biscuit Love). It took us around 10 minutes to get through the line and order our food, which I consider pretty amazing for peak brunch time on Sunday without a reservation. I ordered the avocado toast with one fried egg and my BF had the fried chicken biscuit with gravy. We each had coffee and lucky for me they had just started serving frose (rose with watermelon puree and vermouth). It was delicious, refreshing, and not sweet at all which is how I like my rose. The coffee was strong and delicious and came out pretty quickly after ordering it. The drinks were really on point. Our entrees came out on paper plates and we had to use plastic silverware. This was really confusing. The ambiance is sleek and upscale, so this was quite a bit of a turn off and left something to be desired. It's also difficult to eat a messy fried chicken biscuit with gravy using a flimsy knife and fork. Also my avocado toast looked slopped on the plate. I thought that was again weird for a nice establishment. Especially when the total cost with tip was $32.00 (I did get alcohol but still). 
However, what the food lacked in visual appeal more than made up for in taste. Both dishes were very good. I would leave the egg off the toast next time, but it was still fresh and tasty. We sampled the jalapeno grits which sounded amazing but were pretty forgettable.

We strive to find dog friendly, outside areas with shade and this is about as good as it gets in town. Rarely do we have to wait for a table and all outside tables are shaded.

48,2.0,"Came on a Sunday for brunch. First impression was confusion with two entrances and people did not know where the line formed. If you want to order breakfast, coffee, wine, you stand in the front line. If you want to order a salad, walk to the back of the restaurant. If you want to order prepared foods for later, walk to the back of the restaurant. No signage or direction was really given.

Ordered the fried prosciutto sandwich with spinach and poached egg with a side of parmesan potatoes. The hizzy (husband) got the brunch burrito and jalapeno grits. I asked for hot sauce and was told to go to the front to get it. Very inconvenient. They only have ONE bottle of hot sauce for the whole restaurant by the entrance. Not even by the eating area. And it was empty.  While my fresh food sat at the table 75 feet away, I had to wait for someone to refill that bottle. Like had to go to the back and refill. No extra bottles anywhere. The sides were both delicious! Although, jalapeno grits need some spice. I tasted no jalapeno. False advertisement. The potatoes were yum. My sandwich was less than desirable. Not very flavorful. The burrito was very good! Meat filled and a good blend of flavors. Prices were affordable. The huz thought they could have charged more for the burrito, but was happy they did not.

The chairs and tables are so pretty, but the chairs are too short for the tables. Now, I am short so this is exaggerated for someone like me. My husband who is almost 6' tall felt the same way. He actually mentioned it first. It is nice to have pretty decor, but utility should be first for a restaurant. We did not like the flow of the space. That line is really blocking the rest of the restaurant off. It was just awkward. 

Parking is definitely an issue, but if I lived close by, I would totally walk in for a salad or prepared meal. Just be prepared to drop some cash. $13/pound under 3 lbs of purchase for the prepared foods. $11/lb if over 3 lbs. Whole foods and Turnip Truck is almost half this price for the prepared foods.

The turkey/apricot sandwich and Cuban sandwich were delicious. The dessert, charcuterie selection and wine area were awesome. 

The zucchini sandwich, however, was really disappointing. As (I believe) the only vegetarian sandwich on the menu it should consist of more than just zucchini and cheese on thin bread. I would equate it to a ""tea sandwich"" or finger sandwich. It absolutely needs something else on it or at least heartier bread.

The apartments are not yet occupied, but I still had to drive to the 3rd floor and try to fit into a parking space that was designed for a Mini Cooper.  There was one small elevator which never arrived, so I walked the three levels.  I can't imagine how parking will be once the apartments, hotel and other retail stores are open.

54,1.0,"I've been to the C & B in Charleston, but last night was my first time in the Nashville location.  
I will never go back.

Firstly, the space is inconveniently laid out.   I had to go to three different stations to order what I wanted, and then go to yet a fourth station to pay.  Maybe it's possible to have some communication between the serving stations and the coffee bar, so I can order coffee from the food station, and go to the coffee station to pick it up, instead of having to wait in line again to order coffee?

But that is not the reason I will not go back.
The food I had was all very good, and it's a nice-looking, clean place.
The service, however, was the most insulting and rudest and hostile I've encountered in a long time.

Many of the items in the cold prepared food section were not labeled, so I told the man behind the counter that I was a vegetarian, and wanted to make up a plate of a few items that didn't have meat, eggs, seafood, etc.     I asked him what items were vegetarian, and he growled at me and said ""just tell me what you want"" in an incredibly rude and hostile manner.   I assumed, thusly, that he would steer me away from any items that weren't vegetarian.   I pointed to one item, and asked if if were vegetarian.  He said ""how much you want,"" hostile and rudely, like I was wasting his time.   I said a spoon.  He put a spoon's worth on the plate.  I pointed to another item, and asked ""how about that?"" and he said, again, ""just tell me what you want"" in such a hostile way, I was really taken aback.  He was surly and beyond rude.  He made no effort to mask a nasty and rude temperament. Every time I tried to confirm that an item was vegetarian, he would just say ""tell me how much you want."" I finally said to him that I thought he was being unnecessary hostile and rude and not helpful.    

I left it at that, and went to pay.  One bite into my dish, however, I tasted shrimp.  I went back to the counter, and asked him what the salad was. He said shrimp salad.  I  asked him why he would give me that after I repeatedly told him that I was a vegetarian, and he just glared at me.    

I asked to speak to the manager, who was the other man behind the food station.   I told the manager that his server was rude to me, and the manager said ""I don't think he was.""
WHAT?
I was stunned.  
You know what, Mr Manager? I don't care what you think.  Your job is customer service, and to find out why the customer felt he had a terrible experience.
Did you do that?
No. 
You immediately sided with the server, without having any idea what transpired between us.  The restaurant was noisy, the server's back was to the manager, and there is no way on earth that the manager could have heard what his server said to me, or the tone in which he said it. 
None.  
Yet, he sided with the server instead of finding out what happened?!?
He also did not offer to refund the cost of the shrimp salad that I asked him to remove from my plate.

Perhaps non-vegetarians might not empathize with my anger, or think I'm overreacting, but if you are a vegetarian of long standing and mistakenly eat meat because of someone else's incompetence and hostility, I think you will understand how angry I was.

I asked for the rude server's name, but the manager would not give it to me.  When he saw how angry I was, he finally tried to be friendly and very insincerely conciliatory,  but I told him it was too late.   He had a chance to find out what the problem was, but, instead, he quickly defended his worker and told me, essentially, that I was wrong.
The manager needs to learn to listen to all sides of a story, and to show some concern for a customer's complaints before telling the customer that he is wrong.  
When he finally wanted to listen, it was too little, too late.
And the server needs to understand that it is the customers' business that allows the corporation to pay his wages, and he best be polite to ensure that they come back.
I will not ever be treated that badly and rudely.

I recognize and can overlook that people are not always in the happiest mood, and I can overlook occasional surliness, but the manager's and the server's attitudes were both beyond the pale, and I can not condone a manager who told me that I was wrong, before he even knew what his server said and the manner in which he said it.
I always thought the customer was right.

#1 - ordered a cheese steak - you were out of Kaiser  rolls, not the end of the world but you were also out a cheese that a gentleman ordered on his salad and some thing else the lady behind me ordered
#2 after looking around at other dining options I came back and ordered a roast beef sandwich...2 workers were in the back for minutes...when some one 
finally came out she made my sandwich and gave it t the wrong person...I said to the employee I thin you just gave my sandwich to someone else...she said ""it's dirty back here I don't know what ticket that was"". So she reluctantly and made my sandwich and the kicker to this evening was she almost threw the sandwich at me and said 'here you go"" as if she was bothered by the fact that I ordered food from your establishment. 

I was absolutely disgusted at the fact that you were nearly out of everything then after I came back I was treated as if your company did me a favor after screwing up the order then finally making the sandwich...by the way it wasn't all that great.

but please don't take my word...I encourage you to talk to the manger on duty because the young lady who made my sandwich has no business working in front of customers.

This isn't a typical sit down restaurant. You order your food and pick it up at the front much like a fast food restaurant. I ordered 2 sandwiches and waited 30+ minutes before the owner finally checked on me. She went around to customers before me and apologized for their wait, offered refunds and free drinks. For me?

He sat down and I noticed he wasn't extremely happy with his spot cause of the draft he was feeling. A sweet woman who works here walked over to him and asked if she could help him with anything. As a result, she ended up moving from table to table with this man, carrying his things for him, and helping feel all the tables to see if there was still a windy draft. Once he finally decided on a spot, she smiled completely genuinely and asked if he would like a glass of water - now remember, this isn't a waiter/waitress based restaurant, she was doing this just to be kind. She brought him water, and when he said his sandwich was too cold, she happily went and heated it up for him. That is the kind of service and genuine kind-heartedness I wish I saw more in the world.

First the frose was very bitter. The champagne used in this is a cheaper brut which needed to be balanced with more sugary elements. Of the 8 girls that came with me no one liked their frose. I sent mine back for champagne. If you want a frose go to sambuca. 

My BYO plate is was under seasoned and poorly cooked. My eggs had no salt or pepper on them and were watery. My bacon sat in it's on grease which is not appetizing. When you cook bacon put it on something to let the grease drip off. My biscuit was the worst of all. It was hard as a rock and most of it was inedible.

97,2.0,"Ok so this place is a pass. Mainly because the food is pretty horrible. Surprisingly bad. I'll start by saying it's a super cute place, it has the atmosphere, a pretty good ordering system and great drinks. We didn't have trouble ordering or finding a table even though it was super busy. We ordered coffee and OJ both were good and I ate a chocolate croissant that was amazing! 

However, two of us ordered omelettes, they are $10 and come with one small side. I got mine egg whites with the spinach, tomatoes and goat cheese, I couldn't believe when they brought it out firstly it was tiny secondly it didn't look good it looked like one of those rubbery omelette made in the rubber mold in the microwave. I got potatoes as a side they were awful, super dry and drowned in Parmesan cheese and a cheap cheese. The plating was horrendous too for such a cheap place they stick your omelette on a paper plate with nothing else (it looked sad) and gave you your potatoes in another paper container. Why are they using paper and not real China? It's bad for the environment and made my $10 meal look like a $4 mall food court item. My friend ordered the omelette with whole eggs and grits as the side. Hers looked exactly like mine like it came from an ""As seen on TV"" rubber mold and she had grits on the side. Also she said it was bad. Our other friend ordered the quinoa bowl and mid way through stopped eating it and asked her why, she said they haven't cooked one or two of the vegetables they are still raw and it's not good. 

The service is lackluster, I ordered a side biscuit (which by the way was not good) they don't bring it with butter or jam you have to request it and they send you to wait in the line at the bar for it again. They also aren't friendly the people bringing you the food not the ones at the bar those are super nice. Their water was out so we had to wait for them to refill and that took forever.

First the positive:  the interior is bright and fun.  The space is large and can easily accommodate groups meeting for lunch.  The lunch counter is open at 9:45 am. 
 The staff was nice. 
The negative:
The line at the coffee bar/breakfast line had about 7 people in it and others were standing waiting for their food to be ready.  I wanted to try the ricotta toast but I did not want to wait 30 minutes for toast. So I ordered lunch. 
My roasted chicken wrap had plenty of chicken which was nice. There was also plenty of arugula. But that was about it.  There should have been tomatoes, red onion, cheese and a spread. One bite had a taste of a dressing/spread.  Also, there was at least 1/3 of the tortilla left once I ate the filling. No chips or side item or drink. The wrap cost $9.50.

103,2.0,"Was so excited for this place... but I believe the leadership & execution here, particularly in the Kitchen, needs some serious revamping.

I've eaten at Caviar & Bananas in Charleston, and we had the most amazing sandwich! Their ingredients were fresh, the menu well thought out and even better prepared, and staff was sharp and knowledgable.

At this new Nashville location though, I was missing those things.

The location, layout, decor and ambiance of the restaurant gets an A+, it's one of the nicest in Nashville. But the food, was sadly very disappointing. 

The sandwich we got had Arugula, Egg, Turkey and some other stuff, and it looked amazing... but it had weak and cheap tasting bread, and cheap tasting Turkey. I'm not sure what they use, but it was very disappointing and reminded me of cheap packaged deli meat... especially for the price this was a shock. We also got avocado toast which reads great on the menu, but again thin / cheap bread and an old (dark green) avocado spread that didn't taste fresh at all. We love Avo toast! So this was a bummer.

We also got a Quinoa Kale Veggie Breakfast bowl, but the overall taste of the quinoa and veggies was slightly undercooked and the ingredients weren't prepared to compliment each other. The eggs on top were fine... The staff was very sweet, but wasn't sure what one of the items in the dish even was... they did refund the dish after I talked with them about not enjoying it all, which was awesome. Then i ordered the recommended Chicken Biscuit instead, and it was unfortunately worse. The cheese tasted cheap, the scrambled eggs were soggy, and the chicken was thin and soggy itself, which was crazy. I was actually so surprised because Nashville is a great Fried Chicken town and this was the worst piece of Chicken I've had here... A $3 Chicken biscuit from Chic-Fil-A or Zaxbys would have been much much better taste and better quality chicken (I know, strange)... and this cost $10. Also, I ordered it with Parmesan Potatoes which might have been okay but sadly they came out cold and not fresh... like they had been sitting on a counter for 45 minutes... 

We did order a croissant with strawberry jam and it was amazing! So props there... 

For what this place could be, it has a lot of improvement to make. They have a great foundation, beautiful space, sweet people, and awesome croissants... they just really need to up the game on the quality of the food! And please do!

As far as groceries, lots of curated items from both Nashville and beyond. They have McClures pickles... being from Michigan I got super pumped about those. They also carry Jenis Ice Cream pints which are down right dangerous. Great selection of coffee, sweets, cheeses, charcuterie and wine.

The only reason it's not a full 5 is the parking situation.

They have options for all sorts of diet restrictions and allergies, and a small shopping section with fun & unique juices, chips, and snack options.

The Thai meatballs and kale salad were TO DIE FOR, so fresh and so delicious--a must try...kale lovers and kale skeptics will enjoy it.

The whole store is really cute and very well curated - it's exactly where I would go for a quick lunch between meetings, or to pick up a gift for a friend. Their salad station, sandwich station and wine room all looked amazing and I'm excited to try them.

I also felt good about the parking situation. if you park in the garage directly behind the store they will validate your ticket.

This morning I ordered the Brunch Burrito with a side of grits. The burrito was DELICIOUS. Really tasty and well-balanced. I was initially unsure about the lemon component, but it added a nice zing while I was eating it.

The only downside for me was the grits. I ordered my burrito without pork because I'm a vegetarian. I ordered grits as my side and it turned out that bacon was mixed in with the grits. This component of the dish wasn't listed on the sign, and it would have been nice for the cashier to mention it since I specifically requested no pork on my burrito. They did happily replace it with the potatoes, which were tasty and much appreciated.

144,3.0,"I really tried but don't get the ""a-peel"" of Caviar & Bananas.  First off, it's all metered parking or pay for the covered garage next door. So lunch with a friend ended up costing $8 to park. The space is large and open, filled with light and multiple places to sit.  There are three stations to order food along with to-go items and a small market area. We arrived before 11:30am so the first station was serving breakfast along with coffee & teas. I assume it would have a lunch menu after 11:30 but didn't check before I left. The other two stations make salads or sandwiches. There's the option to order from the menu or make your own, pretty standard choices and most things on the menu contain meat so not a lot of choice for vegetarians.  I decided to go with the ricotta toast.  To me the bread is the foundation when ordering toast and it can make or break the meal. This toast was two standard slices of bread from a grocery store loaf, so nothing special at all. Topped with ricotta cheese, pistachios and honey, it was filling but that's about all I can say. My lunch companion was equally as unimpressed with her egg sandwich. I ordered a hot tea, which was the standard tea bag in a paper cup of hot water. I assume the attraction here is the location, making it a place for surrounding business people to walk to for a quick meal. Definitely no reason to drive out of your way for a cafeteria style meal.

158,4.0,I've dined at Caviar and Bananas on several occasions. I guess it is the desserts that keep me coming back. I have ordered salads and sandwiches and they were good. Yes they are a bit pricy but then many of Nashville's trendier restaurants are and even some of the less trendy. I would go back because I can get a good salad and sit down and enjoy it while I am on my lunch break. The atmosphere is fantastic. The staff super friendly and helpful. I am only knocking off one star because they are pricy. I would recommend them for sure. My only real negative comment would be they have no way of assuring that the food people eat is being paid for. It is based on the honor system. Students love to dine and dash.

1. $4 parking (0-60min)- No validation
2. Dining area had too much furniture and was not clean.
3. The shelves with drinks, chips, etc. looked like they were having a close out sale. Empty.
4. Rude employees...
5. Trash cans were overflowing and they didn't even have openings big enough to accommodate the containers the food was served in.
6. If one of your family members order a salad, and the other a sandwich, you can't pay for them together. It's weird.

161,4.0,"Everything about this location confused me at first. As an alum of the building across the street, I was perplexed at how such a massive building with so many parts would fit *right there*. Like, how would that work? As a result, I gave it some space for a while. Not that it did anything wrong. I just didn't understand the physics behind the construction. And then I ventured inside...

I don't know how they did it... I don't know what kind of witchcraft was involved but the powers that be managed to create a space that's light, airy and much more massive than I would imagine from the outside. This isn't Caviar & Bananas' first time at the rodeo -- and it shows. This is the perfect Midtown breakfast/lunch spot. With dedicated areas that fit whatever mood you're in, you're sure to find something to suit your needs. Want a gluten-free muffin? Do it. Need some frozen rose in your life? All the time! I mean, you can find that here. Feel like some bougie grocery shopping? Okay. Looking for some international candies? They have 'em. In the mood for a sandwich? They can do that.* Fancy a salad? Let's do that... and that's what I did. A very smiley and kind young woman walked me through the menu. She told me her favorite was the Baja, so I ordered that. I was planning on eating my salad there but she prepared it in a to go box. I don't know if that's standard (a set up like C&B seems that it should go hand in hand with cool plateware) but it happened. With the to go box in hand, I took the salad to go and made my way home.

The salad was delicious. The combo of romaine, cotija cheese, avocado, corn, tomato, cucumber, jicama, pickled onions, and pumpkin seeds was a nice, bright burst of health with every bite. I haven't had much jicama since leaving Miami so that was a nice plus and the pumpkin seeds added depth to what could have been a flat salad. I was particularly pleased with the sliced avocado on top of the salad because I love avocado and rarely get a full one in a salad. I asked for the chipotle lime vinaigrette 'on top' and the dressing came mixed into the salad so it was more of an element of the dish than a last minute addition. C&B is a pretty spot on fast casual ladies who lunch destination. If you would have mentioned the concept and location five years ago, I would have said you were crazy. After being there a couple of times, I don't know what took so long.

We tried this before they closed the first time and we've tried it again after it re-opened and we just don't see how they will stay open for long.

172,4.0,"If you are a food blogger, Instagram queen (or king) or an aficionado of all things trendy and cool then C&B is your spot. C&B is a specialty market and cafe which started in Charleston, SC and I've not seen anything like it in my time in Nashville. The interior is immaculate from their perfect displays of pastries and sweets to pre-made salads and wines. Whether you are there to shop, eat or drink you will be impressed by the novelty of everything in C&B. 

The place--
It took me a few seconds to orient myself settling my eyes upon the different stations available to order food. Did I want a salad, a sandwich or to grab something to go? It was a bit much to take in at first then I appreciated all the choices. When I was waiting for my order I was thoroughly entertained. Although I got my order to-go since I work nearby I would think it would be fun to dine in as well. 

The food--
I ordered the Tennessee Trio sandwich ($10.50) which had porchetta, pork belly and bacon jam along with cheddar, pickled sunchokes and arugula on a ciabatta roll. The flavor was all there and it was a very filling sandwich. The porchetta was a bit too crispy for me and the sandwich was a little too rich for me to order it again but I did like it. I got a bag of Zapp's New Orleans Kettle Style voodoo chips ($1.95) and a small blueberry hibiscus iced tea ($2.60) to go with my sandwich and my total was $16.44 which is a bit steeper than I want to pay for a sandwich, drink and chips but for a splurge every now and again I suppose it's okay. The iced tea is not sweetened at all in spite of the blueberry I picture being slightly sweet naturally, this was not at all. If you want a little sweet I would suggest putting some sugar in before sitting down. 

The service--
My drink and sandwich took only a little bit to order. It can be a bit off-putting to have to go to two different counters to order but it didn't take much time. The front register for the barista will check you out if you get anything from one of the back counters. 

Overall, this is a place I'd meet a friend or perhaps treat myself for a nice lunch.

The signature drink is a sesame latte, my wife ordered it and at first the flavor was strange. Adding sugar is necessary because the sesame flavor is bitter. We expected this drink to be unique, but would not order it again.

We also ordered an almond croissant that ""looked"" delicious, but was as hard as a brick and we had to throw it in the trash it made a loud thud noise. The barista was rude, I asked her if the baked goods were made in house, she smugly responded, "" I don't bake the items, but a baker does.""

Good: Sandwiches.  My french dip sandwich was a 5, but my wife's salmon sandwich was a 4.  It was a bit ""fishy"" and the salmon was chopped up and a bit under seasoned.  The strawberry cake was a bit underwhelming, as was the peach carrot cake.

Branzino special was perfectly cooked and super tasty. But the absolute best was the gnocchi gorgonzola. They make it in house daily. They were fluffy pillowy dumplings. Like everything that you want a gnocchi to be, and rarely is. The cream sauce was buttery and cheesy without being heavy (but that could've been the case because I was already levitating from the taste and texture of the gnocchi itself?). The decor was warm and melodic Italian music played softly. Luigi, the owner and native Italian, visited our table after every dish was served to check on us. He was lovely.

The admission is a few dollars cheaper than the one on Whyte but your also only getting one drink here as opposed to as many as you can drink during your visit. The drinks here are great though. The chai latte I had was far better than the watered down junk I used to get at Starbucks and who would really expect a high quality drink from a place where the drinks are not the main focus? It was a great surprise!

The cat room is really cute and homey although admittedly a bit small. My friend and I were the only customers for the hour that we were there though and it was so nice being able to love on all the cats and not have to deal with a horde of other patrons attempting to get their attention.

There are some board games and cat puzzles if you'd like to spend your time doing something other than petting cats - Say what?

The owners, Nicole and Mike, are absolutely lovely.  Mike has a real passion for the purrfect cup of coffee and Nicole is a cat queen!  They fell in love with the concept of cat cafes when visiting Seattle a few years ago and have been on a mission since to open the purrfect Cat Café! 

Kids need to be 7 to come here - always good to call ahead and double check the current policy though in case there are any changes. 

And if you're looking for the purrfect gift for that special feline in your life, Paws has you covered from funky bow tie collars to cat wine, they've got it all!

All the treats and beverages here are locally sourced - Support local!

The only way to improve would be a larger location.  The cat room itself is quite small in comparison to other cat cafes in town but otherwise this place is MeOw-A-riffic!

Also, while you are here be sure to draw a cat or leave a purrfect note on their chalkboard wall - YES!

This is a large operation with a variety of different styles of food, and is very nicely done with an open and bright decor. You can tell that they are just getting up on their legs. Tonight's service included a very nice garden salad that was not your usual dish of iceberg lettuce with a yellow tomato. It was fresh, bright with variety and garlic bread croutons on the side.  I followed this with a 12"" Margarita pizza and a tooth achingly cold Stella. I mean that in the best of ways.

My pizza was a pleasant surprise... very fresh, very nice sauce and not heavy at all. The crust was light and wonderful.

My server, Kim, was friendly and attentive and did a great job. The manager checked on me a couple times and was friendly and was encouraging me to come back with friends. She's got experience in the business and seems like a true professional.

I've had a similar business and I know what a daunting task it is to open those doors and wait for the crowds to come in.

This place is huge inside and VERY clean (and empty -Monday after Easter).  We were immediately  greeted by a wonderful waitress.  We were amazed by how large this restaurant was. There is a meeting area (Civitans were there tonight), a bar area, a children's area, and a lot more seating! 

We ordered the eggplant balls (fritters) and a large pizza. Both were delicious! The fritters seemed to be made fresh and the pizza's crust was very light. Our waitress said that  the recipe was from the owner's family. It was probably the best pizza crust I have had in a LONG time.

This restaurant has one of the strangest layouts that I've ever seen.  We were seated in ""Piazza Grande"", which is the large seating area in the front near the ""food court"".  I was confused as to what the food court was supposed to be.

From where we were sitting I could see a little into the sports bar section.  I didn't look in the ""La Veranda Ristorante"" section, which is apparently the more upscale section of the restaurant.

Maybe that's cheating to slip cheese in there but it is a real treat to find good sauce in an Italian restaurant in tampa. 

We ordered the eggplant parmigiana and two pizzas. One gardinia pizza with eggplant,  zucchini and other vegetables. And a classic margherita pizza as we wanted a point to compare to the other places we've tried. 

The pizza is good. Three stars. The toppings were good. Mine came out a bit too cool but my husbands pizza was piping. My mother loved the pizza. The crust can be better but it is good pizza for the average person (I'm admittedly a  pizza snob). 

The eggplant parmigiana was 4 stars. Very good. A delight!  Eggplant very tasty. My husband thought it was too mushy but I liked it. The cannoli's were very good. The filling was a little thin for me but good flavor. Apparently they have tiramisu too. 



The service is out of this world. Sam greeted us at the door and was very friendly. Heather our waitress was on top of all concerns. A young man came out to serve the pizza and he was laughing and joking with us 

The music there is soooo amazing!!!  I was rocking out to bon jovi and Michael Jackson. 

The place is huge. Lots of money put into that place. They need to market more to get it packed. No one was hardly there.

235,4.0,"Roman Forum is a relatively new restaurant (opened about 6 weeks ago) and they are located on the northern end of a strip mall along N. Dale Mabry Highway in Carrollwood. You'll find the Roman Forum in the same strip mall as Burger Monger, but these folks are on the far northern end near the bagel shop.

The restaurant is huge inside, and it's clear that they are still developing their ideas as not everything is up and running. You have a big sit-down restaurant, as well as an area carved out to be a cocktail lounge. Additionally there are glass cases which will eventually hold salads, wraps, sandwiches, and hot pizza for carryout orders. Also the restaurant has built drive-through windows on the north side of their building.

Right now the restaurant is open for lunch and dinner, but the owner told me that she has plans to also open for breakfast and include Cuban coffee, Cuban toast, and a variety of breakfast items both for sit-down or carryout.

The menu is a nice mix of small plate flatbreads, finger food appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, pastas, and full dinners. Lots of creative choices on the menu, and a welcome addition to this area of Carrollwood.

On my latest trip I had a cup of their seafood soup which had crabmeat, shrimp, calamari, and cubes of fish mixed with Italian herbs in a light tomato broth. spicy and delicious. I also enjoyed their special of the day which was the sea bass sandwich. The filet of fish was breaded and fried, and then served on an Italian roll with lettuce, tomato and a spicy guacamole sauce. The sandwich was huge, and I took half home to enjoy for dinner.

I don't know if he was having a bad day or he was angry but he was demanding my order out of me insistently when it was my first visit to this place.

I came there on a mid afternoon, most of the pizza there looked like it was sitting for a while. Tasted like it too.. Like my pizza was reheated in the oven, but I swore it either tasted like old pizza or pizza from yesterday.. I don't know. 

While my service was rude, my pizza tasted a day old and the place looks a little dirty despite it being renovated, I could tell the deep dish pizza was good. The guy before me ordered it and was raving about it, made me kinda jealous I didn't order the deep dish - I guess it must of been made fresh.

There's a few TVs for sports viewing, I think they serve beer and the pizza was pretty cheap.. 2-2.25$ per slice with taxes. I want to give it a 2 rating but this place has potential compared to most of the other non-chain pizza places..... Although I'd say Sbarro might be a step up.

My party had for appetizers the onion straws- really onion rings, very good but expected thinner cut due to name; the seafood queso-very good; the gumbo was reported as good ( I didn't eat any);  the fried soft shell crab plate- very good, nice size but way too many fries, should have been served on toast as most places do to for oil draining which flavors the toast; an oyster poboy and a shrimp poboy were over loaded with fresh fried seafood but on a thick ciabatta type bread-not the traditional French bread-the waitress stated they ran out-this should have been mentioned when ordering so if patron only wanted French bread there is a choice; the Westbank seafood plate was good-nice size for price with sides and seasoned well; and a Mardi salad-very fresh with a good vinaigrette. For the birthday person I requested the bread pudding-pretty presentation but improvement on the recipe needed- too dry, either microwaved too much or not enough moisture in the recipe- glad it was comp'd-would not have been happy to have paid for it. 
Overall the atmosphere was nice, pretty renovation of the place that used to be a Copeland's, all of the condiments were served in little cups, which was ok but a squeeze bottle of Blue Plate mayo was on the table, very out of place, but at least it was Blue Plate (the only mayo of Louisiana!). Finally, prices were reasonable, although the 20% auto gratuity was a bit much for a party of 5. I don't believe in auto gratuity, I know everyone doesn't tip like they should, I always do and usually give more depending on service received with a smile, but when auto, I never give more. Just my policy, I have family whom work in the service industry whom depend on their tips so I understand a lot of people don't even tip.

The sad part is no one liked their food. Lobster pasta tasted like they just dumped a can of tomato paste in the pasta and mixed it into the linguine and the lobster was over cooked which caused it to be chewy. Crawfish etouffee was too salty. Filet mignon tasted like a over cooked sirloin it came with potatoes and vegetables that look like the whole plate been sitting under the light for a long time. As for the chicken caesar salad the chicken was so dry and it had way too much dressing on the plate and it was too creamy. Crab cakes barely had any crab in it and it was just full of stuffing. We ordered Mac and cheese for my niece and it looked like it was made from a Kraft box and dried. My niece usually eats her Mac and cheese and this time she ate a little bit and didn't want it.

The newly renovated building looks nice from the outside, but I feel like the prices do not match with their strange ambiance inside. For example, one side of the restaurant has nice looking tables. The other side of the restaurant uses these cheap, brown laminate tables. It's so weird! Maybe they can decor with some cloth tablecloths or something because honestly, it just feels so strange. Reminds me of eating at a cafeteria. 

The appetizers we ordered were seafood gumbo, chargrilled oysters,and their version of the bang bang shrimp. It was just average. Nothing too unique or special about it. The cheese used on the oysters tasted a little strange. Nothing a little salt could not fix. The shrimp was way too sweet for me. So beware, if you don't want diabetes! :P

The fried seafood platter was very good. It came with a softshell crab, oysters, shrimp and catfish with fries and hushpuppies.It was deifnitely big enough to split with 2-3 people. 

One of the other guests at the table ordered  a roast beef po-boy, but for some reason it was not on po boy bread. It seemed more like a fancy sandwich. The bf ordered the grilled Mahi-Mahi which was pretty good. Tasted very fresh. 

Overall worth a try, but skip if you are going on a fancy date unless you are going to be seated on the fancy side of the restaurant. :P Also, if you are eating in a group make sure to bring cash.

We were here for lunch and there was a good crowd, but it wasn't packed. They have a pretty diverse menu with things like fried catfish, shrimp and grits, pasta and even lobster. I decided to be less predictable this time and I get the corn and crab bisque and the fried catfish Lafitte lunch special which came with sausage jambalaya.

The waitress brought out my entree before my corn and crab bisque. I had intended the bisque to be my appetizer, but I guess I should have mentioned that, The catfish was interesting. It was topped with red sauce (which the waitress mentioned ahead of time) and it was fried nicely. The jambalaya was okay, but didn't really dazzle me.

The corn and crab bisque was just okay, as well. It didn't taste the way other bisque I have had in the past tasted. I don't know how to explain it, but I was expecting more. My dad got the shrimp and pasta and wasn't that into it either. He was so not into it that he let me take his leftovers home so I could eat it later. When I tried it, all it was was flavorless pasta and overcooked shrimp- disappointing.

Our waitress was beyond sweet and made sure that we were happy with everything. Like I said, this spot has only been open a month so I expect them to work out the issues and do okay.

PROS:
-It was bikini night, and twin Peaks actually hires attractive, young girls, that guys enjoy having in our presence.
-No motorcycle gangs- we're in NE Indy, not Amarillo:) 
-Beer was f'n cold, great selection (Bells Oberon on tap), and the prices are reasonable.
-Above average bar food. 
-Large outside patio

CONS:
-Nothing special, as they didn't reinvent the wheel, as far as these types of restaurants are concerned.
-I'm sure some women's lib group classifies this establishment as sexist.
-I'm sure the LGBT mafia will demand that Twin Peaks hires a multitude of transgender species to flaunt their stuff...you know, because 3% of the population should dictate what the rest of the nation wants.
-I'm sure yelp HQ still hates me.

A decent place. I'd definitely return to watch the games, as there are tons of TV's, and the service was spot on as well.

329,4.0,"This is another one of those breastaurants with girls in minimal clothing who go through ""auditions"" for their jobs rather than interviews. It makes for a good place to get some beers and watch football with the guys, and at least this place is a little more unique than some of the other ones around.

I made it here on a Friday night to meet with a group of 10 friends. They had a large table reserved for us, and we were seated quickly. The place is really cool inside, with a lodge vibe that looks like something you would see up in the mountains. It was large, and it wasn't very full the one time I was here. There are more than enough TVs to see whatever sporting event you want to watch without having to turn your head very far.

Their menu consists of appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and a surprising selection of dinner entrees. We ended up with a few appetizers that were pretty good, and a whole bunch of wings. I went with their ""smoked and grilled"" bone-in wings, which were phenomenal. I got them with sauce, but I would probably just get them plain with a sauce on the side since they were that good. They were some of the best wings I've had in the city. That being said, they were also pricier than most, but at least you get what you pay for.

I was surprised to see a decent selection of good local beers on tap. They also had a couple beers under the Twin Peaks brand, and quite a few of the largely distributed craft beer brands. And of course, you can always get an ice cold glass of light domestic stuff as well. 

Service, especially considering we had such a large group, was fantastic the entire time we were eating and drinking. Drinks never went empty before getting a refill and our food came out much quicker than expected. Unfortunately, for some reason that we never figured out, our server went MIA as we were wrapping up and we had to wait around a while before we could actually ask for checks. At least we were done, so the empty glasses and plates in front of us didn't need refilled, but it was still frustrating to be stuck there as we were ready to leave. If it wasn't for that snafu, the service would have gotten 5/5.

I don't have as much of a bias against large chain restaurants as the rest of Yelp tends to have, and I was very happy with what we ended up with out of this place. The food was great, our service was almost great, it is a neat place and there are lots of TVs, the beer list was probably the one shortfall and even it wasn't that bad.

No smile, no interest in the table (a tip for any waiter or waitress and isn't rocket science that's how one makes it in the industry working off of tips) which could have been fairly easy for her as it was just me a harmless 34 year old whom had been cutting down trees for several hours earlier to help a friend who can't do it on their own and as it was 95 out all I wanted was a cold beer and sandwich and the peaks was less than 5 blocks from the house I was at.

They are known for their server's questionable attire(kinds like Hooters) and their 29 degree draught beer.  They actually have a digital reading on the wall of the beer temperature.  They serve it in a frosted 22oz mug.  

The beer was definitely cold that's for sure!  Once everyone else arrived, we started with some appetizers.  We ordered chips and queso with venison chili, two orders of stacked nachos with chicken, and two orders of fried pickles.  The kitchen was definitely moving slow, and it seemed like the front of the house was understaffed.  Both probably were.  The food arrived and was all pretty decent.  I ended up eating a whole order of nachos to myself and decided to be fat and order mozzarella bites for dinner.  Everyone else got actual entrees.  

Everyone seemed to enjoy the rest of their food.  I noticed on the way out there were a LOT of open tables all over the place but they were on a 45 minute wait.  There's no excuse for being understaffed on a Saturday in Castleton.  Not to mention there was a fight about to start which required a 5 dollar cover, I mean come on.

One thing I've noticed is that they hire pretty women, hence the name Twin Peaks...you'll catch that on the way home. My waitress was Elizabeth...all the way from AZ...very pretty lady with tattoos and piercings. Anyway, I sat by the fireplace because I was cold (you would think ""why on a summer day?"")...I'm always cold.

Anyway I got the Steak salad (med. rare...just the way I like it) with a cilantro lime vinaigrette dressing.

My associate ordered the meatloaf with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The meatloaf looks like a steak. It's baked and grilled, however it is shaped like a steak. He said it was good. I didn't want to eat too much it was getting late. I contemplated on a dessert which was a bread pudding and some sort of brownie with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and a whole bunch of fixings...it sounded really good, I just think I was in the mood for something that heavy right before a movie.

Cons: Restrictions on glass size for beer selections with higher ABV% (If you're not driving, then your glass size shouldn't matter), the drive in and out of the parking lot is riddled with potholes, menu items are overpriced for food has is only average in quality. 

The other guests in my party felt that their food was about average, but overpriced for what amounts to being nothing more than your typical bar food. I ordered the Ghost Pepper wings after being informed by the waitress that they were ""really hot,"" but they were nothing of the sort. The wings were small, dry,  overcooked and the heat level of the sauce was very disappointing. Their Ghost Pepper wings had about the same heat level as what you might expect from the ""hot"" selection on a menu at BW3. 

Overall, the environment was aesthetically pleasing and the staff were very courteous, but the food was nothing to rave about. I have to agree with the guests in my party: The food quality is what you might expect to find in any pub, only more expensive.

But don't throw me the bill unless I ask for it, makes people feel like they are not allowed to order more. Especially when they don't even acknowledge that you are there after. Gave the server $20 on a &45 dollar bill. You would think they would try and get more out of me at that point!! But no, did not speak to me once after I paid. 
I understand that this place has a theme, and that's mainly what people go for. But that only gets you so far. I have gone through the reviews of this location and others. And I have not seen management even try and apologize once at this location, once!!Where as at the other one I looked at. First review I read management had responded.

371,3.0,"Twin peaks has been open for a couple of months and I had heard good things about the food and the scenery and decided to check it out. I was told by some of my friends that it was substantially better than Hooters in both regards as well. 

We were seated faster than I expected and initially thought it was strange that we were sitting at a very long table along with others. The table was separated by a piece of wood with an ax in it. It actually worked pretty well. 

Our waitress, Alyssa, was very friendly and brought us our beer pretty quick. It was the coldest beer I have ever had and it was served in a FROZEN glass not just frosted. The surface of the beer froze in about a minute. The beer was certainly a great experience.

Alyssa and the other waitresses were wearing tight tan shorts with red ""shirtinis"" (a word I just made up to mean a bikini top that has just a little more fabric to make it look like a shirt). They were for and friendly. 

The food was a mixed bag. I had the cheese bites as an appetizer. They were fantastic. My only complaint was that there weren't enough of them. My meal was  was the bbq bacon burger and fries. The fries were pretty good. They are a steak fry with a season salt. I would have liked more seasoning but my fiancé wanted less. The burger is the problem. It had great presentation and the bacon was done well but when I started getting into the burger, it fell flat on flavor. There was very little sauce and the meat didn't have a full grilled taste. I would expect a burger and fries that cost $9 would be grilled and it was obvious that It came off of a flat grill.

377,3.0,"The wife and I stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon for an early dinner after catching a matinee up on 96th street. The parking lot was about half filled, but it looked like a lot less people inside as the restaurant is HUGE and very open. We were greeted by no less than 6 waitresses/hostesses standing around the hostess station. The person taking us to our table, who ended up being our waitress, decided to finish her conversation she was having with the other girls before seating us. It was kind of annoying, but she was very pleasant otherwise. 

The menu isn't extensive as others have previously mentioned. I decided on the ""hangover burger"" which is your basic hamburger with the addition of a fried egg on top. It was good but I have to say I prefer the Royal Red Robin over it. The fries served with it were pretty tasty with the seasoning they added to them. My Wife decided to just get the pulled pork nachos appetizer for her meal and we would share them. WOW there was a lot of food on that plate. They were very good, but I was too full to be of much help after my burger and we barely scratched the surface. At one point the waitress came by and said, ""I was going to tell you how big they were after you ordered them.""......haha ok why didn't you? We took them home and had them the next day. No big deal. 

My favorite part about Twin Peaks, besides the obvious, was how cold the beer was! They are very proud of how cold they keep the beer as there is an indicator on the wall keeping customers informed of just how cold it was. It fluctuated from 27 to 30 degrees while we were there. While there isn't an overabundance of choices, it was super refreshing. The top of the beer had small ice crystals forming it was so cold. DELICIOUS! Especially on a 90 degree day.

I don't think it would be a monthly trip, but we would definitely take friends back for the experience or just drop in for a drink. Like I said, the inside was huge with plenty of TVs everywhere you looked.

The Indy 500.  While thousands rushed to the track to drown themselves in alcohol in the blazing sun watching race cars zoom across the track going at speeds I've never traveled, I learned in the background.  I made a decision to go in search of a good spot to watch the race on television yesterday and that is a good thing today.  It sent me spiraling to Twin Peaks, a place I had listed on my calendar and scratched off the original day I chose to go.  Still my sub-conscious would not let me forget what I had tried to erase.  It pushed me in that direction and I arrived and met my destiny restoring the balance of today.  I walked in with a quarter.  I ordered a water and sat at the bar.  My bartender was a seasoned veteran.  She'd been there since it opened.  Her next career goal in life is to be a housewife.  I sat there for hours, just learning from the environment and her.  The pack sitting to my left get louder as their drinks keep getting refilled.  One of them speaks up and decides to order shots for the group.  I chime in, can I have one too?  No.  Then he changes his mind, calls it karma, and orders me up one.  Did we just become best friends?  No.  I soon learn what attracts me to the bartender, she reminds me of a person I knew in the past, Heather.  Coincidentally enough, a red head strolls into the bar to work next to my bartender and her name is Heather.  So I spend a few hours there just learning and being in the space.  I'm not a king.  I say at one point to the guy who bought the shots.  Kiss the ring bitch.  His response, drowning himself in booze.  When him and his pack are about to leave, he bows and kisses my hand.  

I return after a visit home for a nap and dinner.  My bartender and Heather are still there, grinding it through on a Sunday race day.  I order a glass a house red and the banana pudding.  Both were good then as of today.

""Is it okay to bring your wife and kids there to watch a game?"" The servers do wear low cut shirts and shorts, but nothing that was any different than other themed sports bars. When I was there, there were groups of women together and also couples there. There were a few families with children there. 

The food is what made me give it a try....well that and the ridiculously cold beer. 

I am a big fan of nachos....good nachos. Twin peaks has good nachos, very good nachos. they are big enough for 2-3 people and be pretty full. We ate mostly appetizers while we were there. We had the sampler plate which has mozzarella bites, Fried Pickles and Boneless buffalo bites. They were really good. Even with them being fried they were not soggy from grease. Have boneless chicken instead of bone on wings in a sampler was a great surprise and was welcomed with an open mouth. I also had The cup of chili and it was very flavorful and I wish I would have got The bowl of chili instead. The food over all was above average for a sports bar. next time we might move to entrees next time.

For dessert we had the bread pudding and it was really good. I would definitely get it again. My wife are the ice cream and brownie dessert. She would get it again also. I also wanted the apple dessert they had on the menu, but the server says they don't carry it and wishes they would take it off them menu if they don't plan on carrying it.

It is my new favorite sports bar. Almost forgot they have a crazy amount of TVs and they are numbered so you can ask the server to change that tv to a game you would like to watch.

The hostess wasn't that friendly and didn't seem to be happy that we were there.  Always a good start....

There are more BIG TV's than any place I've ever visited.  There are almost too many if that's possible.  It was a little annoying that even though all of the TV's were the same size and model they couldn't sync the color adjustments so it made for uncomfortable viewing.  At least the feed was all in sync timing wise.

Our server was very attentive and friendly  I ordered the fish tacos which were very good and my wife had the meatloaf which she also enjoyed.  I had a few draft beers which were quite cold.  I didn't really like the frosty mugs though.  They had too much frost and I ended up with a lot of ice in all three of the beers I ordered.

The other servers that walked by seemed to be going through the motions and were never smiling.  They really made it kind of an uncomfortable environment.  I think if they would smile a little it would go a long way to making the place more enjoyable.

Overall the place just seems too large and not the kind of place I would like to hang out and watch sports.  If you advertise cold beer why does it have to come in an icy cup.  It kind of ruins the beer when there is that much ice floating in it.",seKihQKpGGnCeLuELRQPSQ,Twin Peaks,Indianapolis,3.5,-86.0474634,39.9062952,"Sports Bars, American (New), American (Traditional), Nightlife, Bars, Restaurants","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-0:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-0:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-22:0', 'Friday': '11:0-19:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-1:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-0:0'}",6880 E 82nd St,IN

We spent quite a lot of money and were there for a couple hours when a manager told us that we were buying too many drinks and there was a family sitting next to us. We had a driver who had 0 beers or alcoholic drinks, and we were not being disrespectful or rude to anyone. I look over at the family and they weren't paying a bit of attention to us. It didn't look like they were bothered at all.

 Then we were accused of turning off tv's and the manager tried to stare us down. I'm sure he got his courage from the policeman who was working the door. Needless to say, we weren't intimidated.

428,4.0,"This place would be five stars if it was for the fruit flies at our booth. I am pretty sure a fruit fly problem comes from miss managed liquor bottles at the bar. At least, that is what I have learned from Bar Rescue.

Besides that....The food was awesome. I love wings, and their wings were top notch. I got my wings breaded like I would at Hooters, and their breading is nice and crisp. Their sauces are good although not as many to choose from as Buffalo Wing Wings. In always better than Wings, Etc. I liked their wings above all wings because of the breading. You can get them without breading too.

They have two beers that are made for them. One they claimed was like a Blue Moon, but Blue Moon is better. The other is a brown ale. Both were good. They advertise 29 degree cold beer. I had to be that temperature, because it was slightly slushy at the top. I would rather the beer just be in the high 30's. No need to have ice in me beer.

They have TVs at all the booths from what I could tell. It was really neat to watch a college football game at my table. The restaurant sound system was turned to play that game over the speaker system. On a side note, not all the tables were turned to the same channel. Not sure if you can get it changed for your table or not. 

The ambiance of the place looks like the inside of a log cabin. It has a Ron Swanson vibe from Parks and Recreation. Long tables have axes dividing them. Some chairs are made of of branches. Tables are made of slabs of wood. The walls are decorated with pin up girl calendars and beer related materials. The ladies looked very pretty in their outfits.

We decided to order the pretzel and asked if they were large or small (they sell them in 1 or 2 pretzel options).  She said they weren't large so we ordered two.  When they arrived we were surprised at how large they were.  She offered to change it to one pretzel, but it wasn't a big deal so we kept them both.

We both ordered a variation of the philly chese steak sandwich.  I guess I shouldn't have expected much, but the steak was heavily seasoned with pepper and not the most tender meat I've ever had.

I'm not a restaurant manager and I know organization is a big part of this but if you're a customer and waitresses are wandering around and you can't find yours if you ask the first you see for hot sauce or the check the least you expect is being told that she is not taking care of that table and wait.

Wow! How sexist! I can drink most men under the table so screw you basically. ...ordered the ""buffalo chili burger"" I asked if it was actually buffalo meat, she said yes so I ordered it cooked medium so it wouldn't be so tough. It came out cold, well done and stiff as a hockey puck. I sent it back. ..30min later it came out hot and well done like a hockey puck. Management came over and informed me it wouldn't be cooked Medium because they are in fact PRECOOKED beef patties that are topped with 'buffalo chili'. Wow.

Yesterday when I went I noticed alot of families are there to eat. There are a ton of TV's with different sporting games being played. If you order an appetizer wait a minute to order your meal because the food comes out that fast.  I like to take my time eating my appetizer.  
The food so yesterday I got the loaded potato soup and it was so, so good. I asked for green onions on the side to add to my soup.  That soup was so good not salty at all.  It had fresh bacon, potatoes and cheese.  
We also order fried pickles which was enough pickles to feed 4 people.  It comes with ranch,  and they were not greasy at all.  They were a mild flavor pickle so not tart.  I had the cheeseburger and added bacon for .99 cents.  The bacon is a nice thick cut of bacon.  The burger comes with lettuce,  tomato,  grilled onions, and mustard. The bun did break apart on the bottom for some reason. The patty is a thick piece of meat and it was very good.  
I will definitely go back I would like to try their Cuban sandwich.  I was going to get it but she said it's on a hoagie bun.  I would like to see if they can do that sandwich on their Texas toast they serve with the soup.  
Lastly,  I would like to see this restaurant have the tables/ bar top table more spread.  It's like part of the restaurant is social distancing and part of it is not. They are located in Marion County so the capacity should be less according to the Governor rules.  The restaurant both times has been packed with every table filled.

There are times when there are literally 65-70% black and Latino customers and all you hear is music that caters to whites. There have slowly added women of color to the team of waitresses but they don't seem to stick around very long. One night, my friends and I came in for fight night and the place was jammed packed. They took our money at the door and there were no seats available for us to sit in. So we had to stand and hope that four people would leave so that we could be seated. Managers were rude when we asked about it. Probably because there were cops with them that were working in the building that night which is not surprising. We finally spot a table of four leaving and then four guys that had just walked in the building and who just so happened to be white men hurried up and sat at that table and we told them that we were there before they were and management told us that they were there before we were. We knew this wasn't true but it put us all in a potentially bad situation. We are not trouble makers but we were very angry. Especially since all they had to do is write down names at the door and keep track of tables. We saw a waitress arguing with another group of black men for the same reason at the same time and they told us the same thing had happened to them. The point of this review is this: Far too many times black people are treated as if their money is different. The music reflects that and the service does as well.

508,4.0,"If you happen to stumble into Twin Peaks expecting an otherworldly encounter with David Lynch, you're probably going to be disappointed. 

On the other hand, if you stumble into the brand new Indianapolis location of the Texas-based chain of ""breastaurants"" called Twin Peaks hoping to enjoy some good eats, good drinks, and scenic views, then you'll likely be incredibly happy. 

Founded in 2005 in Lewisville, Texas, Twin Peaks opened for the dinner hour starting on 12/8/14 at the former Loon Lake Lodge just East of Castleton at the corner of I-69 and East 82nd Street. 

With its servers all wearing the trademark Twin Peaks cleavage and midriff-baring red plaid tops and khaki shorts, the concept behind Twin Peaks may sound familiar but this variation on the familiar theme is far less kitschy and far more personable than other similarly themed restaurants.

The easiest way to describe Twin Peaks is sports bar meets hunting lodge meets bevy of beautiful women. For those who remember Loon Lake Lodge and its abundance of hunting-themed decor, it makes sense that Twin Peaks choose this spot as its first Indianapolis location. The restaurant has multiple truly accessible parking spots and a set of rather light doors leading into the larger than you expect restaurant. As they just started serving dinners only on Monday of this week and open for regular business hours starting Saturday (12/13/14), the spirit in the restaurant was festive and friendly with multiple staff from the chain's Dallas area headquarters on location for training purposes. Thus, you get greeted at the door by enough beautiful women to make you dream for weeks. 

I worried a little as I arrived as the first bar area and first couple dining areas feature high-top tables/chairs that aren't wheelchair friendly. There's no reason to worry. Twin Peaks has multiple areas that are wheelchair friendly and I had no trouble navigating the restaurant (and was encouraged to do so). 

The menu consists of mostly American fare of a South, Southwest, and Heartland flavor with burgers, chicken, appetizers, a few other sandwiches, and a handful of meals. There's a large alcohol menu, of course, and a couple of desserts. There are two main bar areas, at least 3-4 larger dining areas, a small area known as the ""man cave,"" and there are wide-screen televisions throughout the restaurant and in the bathrooms!

I ordered a concoction known as the Smokehouse Burger with ""fire fries"" for $10.95 plus another couple bucks for my usual iced tea. I tend to be a rather simple burger guy and this particular burger was a bit out of my comfort zone. This may explain why I didn't find it completely satisfying. It tasted a tad underdone. It included cheddar cheese, red onion, BBQ sauce, bacon, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. The burger was easily my least favorite part of the experience, though I'd still put it in the 3-3.5 range. The fries were perfectly seasoned and stellar. The iced tea was also perfection and I did receive my usual refill. 

The highlight of the entire experience was Amanda, and not just because she was beautiful (though she was). She was attentive, personable, outgoing, and just seemed natural. She also scored points for sitting down to talk to me, not just because it's really hard to sit in a wheelchair and have a normal conversation with a skimpily clad young woman but because being at wheelchair height causes the neck to constantly have to stretch and it's nice when someone meets you eye-to-eye. Unlike that ""other"" chain that comes to mind, these young women all seemed comfortable with disability and Amanda, in particular, seemed natural and at ease (NOTE: I did learn she has a brother who is deaf. I'm sure that helps). 

While it was a little slow during the 5pm hour in which I arrived at Twin Peaks, I was impressed with Amanda's personable nature and ability to talk about work, disability, sports, food and, yes, even what it's like to work in a place with an outfit that would make most of us blush. It was refreshingly awesome and, to be honest, not what I expected when I entered the doors. 

The service was stellar. The food was good, though I'll likely stick to my comfort zone next time. The decor was warm, inviting, and wheelchair friendly. The views, as their slogan notes, definitely scenic. While I do lean toward the shy side, I think it's human nature to appreciate a little extra attention and, as Twin Peaks notes on its website, the Twin Peaks girls offer an abundance of ""girl next door"" charisma and playful personalities.

517,2.0,"After driving by Twin Peaks daily for months, we decided to finally pop in to see what all the fuss was about.  We had noticed that the parking lot was PACKED the first few months it was open and initial Yelp reviews were touting Indy's newest breast-aurant as the place to be.  Also, we were curious to see how the cool old Loon Lake Lodge had been transformed in to the new space.

We visited at about 6:30 on a balmy 89 degree Sunday night and were seated on the large wrap-around patio at a huge, tall, heavy wooden table.  There are TVs EVERYWHERE -- hanging back to back over each of our heads, 4 on the wall beside us -- just EVERYWHERE.  The tables on the patio are massive and easily sit 6, and some inside (inside it is HUGE!) looked to seat 10+ or more -- with several smaller parties divided up by a slider depicting an ax through the table.  There was a fire pit at the corner of the patio as well.  

Our scantily clad yet overdressed for the weather (more on this later) little teeny-tiny server was completely friendly, but lacked menu knowledge aside from ""these 2 sandwiches have an egg on them and if you like fish we have trout and fish tacos"".  We later learned that sweet ""Bambi"" had just been in training last week, so we cut her some slack.  

Beer options were surprisingly super limited (no local or craft beers offered), but I decided to give the Dirty Blonde house brew a try -- reminded me of Blue Moon -- served in a big ol' super frosty mug at 29 degrees. I must say it is really tasty with an orange wedge!  

We got the hand braided pretzel ($5) for an app -- served with warm beer cheese (made with the house beer Knotty Brunette) and grainy brown mustard.  Decent.  Greasy(?) but decent.

The food menu is not diverse, folks.  Healthy food eaters beware -- aside from 2 'loaded' salads (a cobb and one other), there were zero real options for a health nut.  Even the broccoli was listed as ""sauteed"" on the menu.  

I threw caution to the wind and for dinner I picked the fish tacos and subbed out the chips and salsa for the mac and cheese (topped with bacon).  The hubs got the Smokehouse Burger and fire fries.  While my fish had a good season on it, there just wasn't a whole lot of it, but there WAS a ton of the cabbage slaw on top.  The mac and cheese was just ok.  Hub's burger came with 2 patties even though he specified just one patty (it is an option for a few bucks less), so he took one patty off.  The patties appeared a little Mc-pre-formed and flat-top cooked -- not grilled.  Disappointing.  The fries were just regular thick cut frozen steak fries with some ""cajun"" seasoning on them.  Meh.    

Food aside, I do have 2 general gripes to share.  Uh oh... 
-- I feel that I need to advocate for the servers here when it comes to their uniform -- and no, not in the feminist ""women are being objectified at Twin Peaks"" kind of way.  What I mean is this -- it was almost 90 friggin degrees outside and you have these gals in thick knee socks and black Ugg boots?  Sure, the top 1/2 of their body gets plenty of ventilation, but seriously?  That footwear and sock combo? And as a former server I know that non-slip shoes in the kitchen were a must... what happened here, folks??  And is Ugg material even sanitary with food rehash and kitchen gunk on them?  Sorry -- just had to be said.

-- My biggest gripe of the whole deal is that they allow smoking on the covered patio while people dine and it is mere feet from the doors in to the restaurant.  There was a dirty ash tray on our table when we sat down and patrons from inside were stepping ""out"" around our table to smoke while we were trying to stomach a meal.  YUCK.  We even had to ask the young men at the table next to us to kindly turn off the fan mounted above their table as it was blowing their smoke directly at us.  UGH. This seriously put a damper on our meal and overall experience.

All in all, I would give our TP experience a one and a half star rating based on the pricey meh-esque food and the aforementioned gripe alone, but the beer was good and our server was really sweet.  I just don't see us rushing back to Twin Peaks for another $50 meal any time soon.

I was so impressed with the food and the service at lunch (Arielle was my server) that I had to come back! From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with friendly smiles and a courteous staff.  While the place was very busy, there was no long wait.  Almost immediately after I was seated, Arielle was there checking on what I'd like to drink and answering my specific questions about the menu.  While I've had people at other restaurants seem irritated when I ask questions, Arielle seemed eager to answer my questions and came across as very authentic and helpful.  Her service was over-the-top, too  (not once did I go lacking for anything), but two other things stood out in my mind as well.  While Twin Peaks is a sports-bar/restaurant, they're very family friendly.  That's unusual for many sports bars/restaurants I've visited. Singles, couples, families, and sports enthusiasts waiting to watch the games were all present. And I can't begin to describe how delicious the food was!  For lunch I had ""Mom's Pot Roast,"" but to be honest mom never made it this great.  My dessert was a Twin Peaks Sundae that was amazing.  For my return trip at dinner, I specifically asked if Arielle was available.  I was informed I was in luck.  She had worked a longer shift than usual today.  I wanted to eat lighter, so I had a cup of Blonde Bean with Bacon Soup (delicious!) and asked Arielle specific questions about the items on the dessert menu I still hadn't tried.  (Again, there was no impatience or indifference.  She was warm and friendly and seemed eager to assist me in making my decision.) I decided to go for the Mini Apple Turnovers with Ice Cream and Caramel Sauce.   They were fantastic, but for something with ""mini"" in the name, I wasn't expecting such a generous serving.  My whole experience (both visits) was fantastic!    As I'm scheduled to leave Indie in a few days (work trip), I regret I won't be able to try many of the other items on the menu until I get back into town.

534,3.0,"The Castleton area is rather lackluster in terms of bars, nightlife, and places to hang out and grab some drinks with friends. So when my friends decided to go out for a pint before an event on Friday, Twin Peaks seemed like the best (and only) choice. I'm not a huge fan of ""titty restaurants"" like this to be honest because I hate that an establishment's theme is around women wearing revealing clothes as they wait on you. It seems rather sexist. But, that's just me being a prude. I'm also not a big sports bar person, as I find all of the TVs to be rather distracting for good conversation over dinner. But, Twin Peaks wasn't that terrible.

Our waitress was very friendly (and not just for the sake of garnering more tips). She legitimately seemed like a nice gal. She wasn't quite knowledgeable on all items on the menu though. Even if your serving at a place that's not a 5-star restaurant, you should still be able to recommend a few things off the menu if you can for the benefit of your customers. She also was a little slow to get to and from our table with our drinks, which I found odd since we were seated right by where the waitresses request drinks of their bartenders.

As for the drinks, VERY sweet. I ordered some kind of boozy lemonade off their drink specials menu, and it was mostly simple syrup/sour mix. Maybe this makes me a functional alcoholic, but I like to taste a little nip of the booze in my drink and not just sweet and sour. I had a taste of one of their house beers (all of which are themed with some kind of lumberjack name) and it was decent. Not anything to go out of your way for, but I could definitely tell this was more of a beer joint than a mixed drink place. Perhaps the bartenders are used to pouring more pints than mixing liquor drinks for all the men coming in to this watering hole.

The food was decent. Twin Peaks definitely redeemed itself in this area. I had some of the mozzarella bites to start, which were quite tasty -- lightly breaded and fried with molten cheese in the center...you can't go wrong with these. I also tried a few bites of the blackened fish tacos -- also very decent with a tangy chipotle mayo that came on them.

After our event, we ended up coming back to Twin peaks for another round and some of the gals came and chatted with us at our table. It was a nice distraction from all of the TVs that were vying for our attention in the place. I can't say that Twin Peaks will be my regular watering hole, but it is convenient, not terribly expensive, and they about the only interesting bar in the Castleton area with PLENTY of seating for a group.",seKihQKpGGnCeLuELRQPSQ,Twin Peaks,Indianapolis,3.5,-86.0474634,39.9062952,"Sports Bars, American (New), American (Traditional), Nightlife, Bars, Restaurants","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-0:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-0:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-22:0', 'Friday': '11:0-19:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-1:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-0:0'}",6880 E 82nd St,IN

It has your basic guys sports bar theme similar to a hooters or tilted kilt when it comes to scantly  clad women. I will say this though, these girls seemed like they truly enjoyed working there and wasn't just working there because of lack of options. 

Also where twin peaks is beating a hooters or tilted kilt is they have a much more dynamic food selection. Not just wings pizza and beer (which they also have).

Now to the dining experience - my buddy and I ordered onion rings and fried pickles to start. They were pretty good. Only issue is they don't give you a menu. You have to ""scan"" their bar code symbol with your phone camera to access their menu. Ugh. 
I kept thinking what would my 88 yr old mother do since she doesn't have a smart phone. But then I suppose she wouldn't be a patron at this establishment. 

My friend ordered the Mom's meatloaf  which is his go to meal here. I made the never ending mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak. I will never again order chicken fried steak outside the state of Texas. I don't care where you go - Texas Roadhouse, Charleston's, Twin Peaks, they all use the same food vendor which gives a chewy cutlet that sits heavy in your stomach. NEVER AGAIN!!

To wash everything down I had 3 beers. Heinekens. The first one was on tap but didn't taste like Heineken so I switched to bottles. Meh.

The highlight of the night was arriving at 7:30 to watch the Colts game and at 8:15 we were informed that because there was a fight on that night each patron would be assessed a $5 cover charge. F that!!! We complained and were getting ready to head over to Ale Emporium when we were informed that due to numerous complaints the $5 fee was waived.

I was curious to know what the lure of his place was and I quickly came to learn what ""Twin peak"" was all about just by looking around. I would almost say that it is a modern day Hooters but I probably shouldn't count them out yet because they are still up and kicking he-he. I could not help but notice that the majority of the patrons were men, mainly older and middle aged. The uniforms were very skimpy shorts and very revealing tops. The women are beautiful, I can't help but to believe that they are very careful and particular during the interviewing process. Our server was delightful. She Was able to answer questions regarding the menu, even stood around and made small talk, very nice. On to the food, and I already checked out the menu prior to our arrival and I knew because I was keeping ut keto that I was going to try the smoke chicken wings out, my love wanted fish and chips, but the chips to be replaced with onion rings,  my side was green beans but I didn't realize that it had pork in it which I do not eat so I passed that on to my honey and he said that it was not a stitch of seasoning on it. My wing portion was as expected, however what we were not expecting was for my honey to only receive one piece of fish. We asked if that was the regular portion size and was told yes. This lunch was pretty expensive for what was received, we had no business stopping in the first place but we could not avoid it because of the type of traffic they receive, the curiosity piqued our interest.

2) My dinner date and I ordered a Mule each.  Very good!

3) She ordered your Chorizo Mac-n-cheese.  Flavor was good.  But honestly, it looked like hamburger helper.

4) I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  It was unevenly cooked.  One end was dry and chewy.  The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken

5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried.  just meh.  some way overcooked and some chewy.

591,2.0,"My wife and I came in shortly after the new ownership took over and while I was pleased at how much cleaner it looked, felt, and smelled... I was really bummed that they took out half the taps and made that remaining selection pretty lame. It didn't help that the one beer I actually wanted they were out of. They also increased the prices of the 'schooner' fills (to the point where it wasn't even a tiny bit of a deal) and reduced the options of what you could put in them. Service was fairly slow, but not as slow as many of these other reviews have indicated.

I'm a beer-lover who strives to always try different things, so a diverse and changing selection is essential to me. I was already really taken aback by the significant reduction in choices, but then to rename the place as a Tap Room? What a slap in the face.

With HopCat across the street, The Pint Room just a hop over in Carmel, and TwentyTap a few blocks south in SoBro, I have literally no reason to ever go back. Additionally, The Sinking Ship only has 8 taps, but they are expertly managed and always have great things. Flat Water has a similarly small number of taps, but their food is anything but basic bar food.

596,4.0,"In one blink there was Chumley's and in the next suddenly there was Village Tap Room.  Don't cry too hard about it, Chum Hums, because walking in, the ghost of Chumley's past seemed to be floating around.  Two weeks in, the setup is the same, the TVs are still in prime locations, and the local beer is all there in drafts, cans, and bottles.  

However, there are changes in the several menus given to you, starting with the cocktail menu.  Our server boasted that the head bartender studied the art of old timey cocktails intensely, reading for six months straight before ever picking up a bottle.  It seems to be the new pride and joy of Village Tap Room.  I apologize for not being about to tell you more about them, because I'm a beer gal through and through.  I can say that I drank my 3 Floyd's Yum Yum with great content, knowing that it was one of many, many beers and ciders to choose from.

And now my pride and joy: food hunting.  Most of you know that I make it my mission to find something tasty everywhere I go.  Smack dab in the center of the food menu was PUFFY TACOS in caps.  I tried to steer away from it--it could be a ploy--but your standard steakburger and tenderloin pub fare were not calling my name.  I chose shredded chipotle chicken as my protein (other options are chorizo, short rib, and pulled pork)  and mango salsa (I wasn't in a charred chipotle mood) to accompany it.  Two puffy tacos and $7 later, I feel confident about my decision of inflated fried flour tortillas stuffed with tender, spiced shredded chicken, sprinkled cheddar cheese, diced tomato, crunchy iceberg lettuce, and mango salsa.  I like knowing that I have a solid go-to if someone wants to sit along the windows, people watch, and drink a pint.

The buns were the cheap, wonderbread, kind you get in the 12-pack for a block party bbq. The chipotle salsa appeared to just be some salsa from a common brand container.

602,2.0,"Really Village Tap ?  Your only five star reviews (2) from people whos only review is for your store ??  One of which is from someone who started yelping coincidentally at the same time you opened ??

I was not impressed, with the exception of one employee who was terrific.  I showed up for a ""tap takeover""....which was anything but.  

Grabbing a seat at the bar.... the first thing to notice was nearly the entire staff gathered at the service station and yapping to each other....never mind the customers...lets stare at our phones, show each other FB posts, and generally do anything that doesn't resemble ""service"".

Exactly 11 minutes and 15 seconds after sitting down, and finally a nice woman inquired as to whether I had been helped.  Nope, not yet !   Don't think my time banished to Irrelevant Island was wasted time....indeed...I was treated to a very entertaining display of the virtuosity of a tres cool bartender totally focusing his benevolent attention on two younger women who giggled and cooed in appreciation of his irreverent commentary and display of serious bartender mad magic skills....this man walked in front of me no less than 9 times...and I am grateful he failed to notice the guy with the red sweatshirt and giant phone....as this allowed the Flirt Show to continue unabated.  Regrettably the two young women were probably a bit disappointed when he would leave to share what undoubtedly were insanely humorous anecdotes and impossibly beneficial life changing commentary to his coworkers at the opposite end of the bar.

This was followed by a man emerging from the bowels of the restaurant with a cash drawer...who could not muster a smile or a hello to customers that presumably might fill said cash drawer.

The beer selection was typical, and fine. But hardly earth shattering in terms of variety...fewer taps than the previous incarnation. The menu IMO, showed little imagination in terms of offerings, and what unfortunately passes as acceptable food in the Midwest.  Basically nothing even remotely healthy....deep fried tacos ""Puffy"" as a signature dish in the middle of the menu ???   Maybe at a college dive bar....but for a place purportedly appealing to an ""older"" crowd....not so much.  Their supposed commitment to ""locally sourced"", or whatever similar term they use, is dubious at best.  Most items appeared to be the type that COULD be fresh off the Sysco truck and right out of the freezer.  

I was afforded further entertainment opportunities watching what few customers were in the place....attempting to flag down their servers for things like water and napkins.  Hint to all servers....if ya are bringing things like Philly cheese steaks, wings, nachos....bring extra napkins.  Don't make customers hold up their hands as if just after washing and just prior to surgery...in an attempt to keep well sauced fingers from soiling their clothing.

Nice tvs, and plenty of them, in... I believe the same locations as before....and as is fairly common across this great land of chain restaurants.  The décor is an upgrade of the previous tenant....but the weird to me.... sort of half-barrel booths in the middle of floor may be sufficiently innovative to appeal to folks looking for a bit of privacy while still enjoying being part of the action.  I however, prefer not to be ensconced, thereby not hindering my creepy ostentatious gazing of hot chicks.

Potato Skins:  These were good, but really, how hard is it to cut up a baked potato, put some cheese and crumbled bacon on top and stick it under the broiler a second to melt the cheese.

I was really excited about this place after I read the IBJ article but nothing that was in that article was real life when we went. 

I will say, our server, when we could get her attention, was very nice.

I made a reservation 4 days in advance and when we showed up they said they didn't see the reservation. We still got a table but it was right up front near the door and it was very uncomfortable. We had trouble getting situated at our high table and his grandparents had an ever harder time. We ordered oysters and none of them were cut properly so we had to scrape them out with our forks before we could eat them. After our appetizers came my boyfriends grandfather had to use the restroom and when we came back he told us there wasn't any soap so he told one of the employees. He intended to go wash his hands when our meals came out so that they would have plenty of time to refill the soap. Our meals came and he went back in the bathroom and the soap still wasn't refilled. Luckily, we had our own bottle of hand sanitizer with us so he had to resort to using hand sanitizer before eating his meal. The worst part is that he ordered a lobster roll. So it wasn't like he was eating with silverware. He had to eat his birthday meal with his hands that he couldn't even get soap to wash. Our total bill was around $160 and I really do not think we should've had to pay $160 for a meal that we couldn't even wash our hands before we ate it. We will never go back to Docs.

The girls doing the shucking cleaned the oysters like pros. I thought the oyster menu's description was a little off.  As a certified oyster geek I'm suprised when I order ""Bright & Clean"" and get ""Rich & Creamy""...don't get me wrong, as long as it's a fresh oyster I love it! I was very disappointed however in the flat, one note vinagar minette that came with oysters; not sure if it was old or just over looked. 

My wife had her first lobster roll and was blown away. Spending 6 years in the Boston area, I have to concur...WOW!  The lobster was cooked expertly and dressed simply, the roll had the wonderful contrasting crispness. Unfortunately the calamari was pretty soggy and the spicy marinara was no where near spicy; I'll skip that in the future for sure.

The oysters-doc-a-feller was good, the oysters were not over cooked and all the ingredients were fresh.  The Cease & Desist fries and cheese fondue sauce was also good, I'm typically not a big fan of this type of dish but I was happy we ordered it.  Solid Fries and the cheese fondue wasn't oily or overdone.

635,1.0,"I went with a friend about 2 months ago and overall, we enjoyed it. This time, I went for a formal dinner with my family and it was a bad experience - none of us will ever return. 

To start things off, we made reservations and were seated at the back of the restaurant where every 20-60 seconds, a door would slam. The heavy slam of the door was noticeably distracting and shook our booth! It would interrupt our conversation and made it difficult to enjoy our meal. So, we had to move tables. However, the waitress - who was less than friendly and outgoing and only grew more sour faced as the night continued - found it appropriate to then move us to a seat directly across the bar instead, without telling us where we were going first. This new seat was hardly better, though we supposed it was the lesser of two evils. 

As the meal continued, we ordered lobster macaroni and the Asian shrimp for appetizers. Both were good, yet we did not get bread and butter until after our appetizers were served and cleared from our table, which we found to be a little odd. Usually, bread and butter comes first, doesn't it? Though it was not too big of a deal in and of itself, it only reflected on how unorganized and out of sorts the waitstaff seemed. 

We ordered our mains, and here is where things became even more problematic. One member of the party ordered filet with potato and green beens, and the beans were crunchy and uncooked, the potatoes dry, and the filet very fatty. Later when our extremely pleasant waitress returned with her typically less than interested attitude to our table, we expressed our concern about the filet and vegetable plate when she asked how the food was...yet she barely reacted with more than an annoyed 'sorry', as if we had done something wrong. If a waitress is going to inquire about the meal but then does not do anything for her displeased customer, why even bother asking in the first place, I wonder...?

I ordered lobster with corn and potatoes, and this was my first time ordering a real lobster dish. I had tried lobster previously and loved it; I figured if Docs is supposed to be an esteemed seafood restaurant, why not try a classic dish? However, for such an expensive plate, I was extremely disappointed. My 35 dollar entree came served without anything to crack the shell and no cocktail fork; another waiter helping the waitress serve acted annoyed when asking for utensils and a plate (can you see a theme here? The waitstaff is either overworked or simply unfriendly!); and the lobster was EXTREMELY tough and chewy, to the point where I was unable to cut it properly, if at all, and it tasted disgusting! Lobster is mild, but it is NOT supposed to be tough and 100% flavorless. I was very displeased. A new waitress I had to flag down appeared vexed though tried to help me. Then, someone - presumably the manager - came instead of our original server and we were told a new lobster plate would be served 'in just a few moments'...yet even after having the chef come out to reassure us, I did not receive my new lobster until 10:05 PM. I waited well over half of an hour for the new lobster plate. Admittedly, I was slightly pissed when our original waitress came out with the lobster just as we were getting ready to leave, and asked if she could box it up. I felt like telling her to take the box and shove it!

It was simply because by that point, we were very tired and tired of being at the restaurant where things had gone from bad to worse. After having at least four different waiters, three of which were aloof and annoyed, and terrible service along with mediocre food, we wanted OUT. Thankfully, the lobster was taken off of the bill, yet for a less than satisfactory evening we paid close to 80 dollars. 

The bottom line: Do not waste your time at this restaurant. Food is a hit or a miss, unpredictable quality and service! There is NO consistency with service and food at Doc Magrogans. Please save your time and money and go to a refutable and classy restaurant such as McCormick and Shmicks or someplace else decent. This restaurant is best for those who want to mess around at the bar and order apps vs. for a group or party coming for a nice lunch/dinner.

Asked for a medium rare brunch burger, received a well done burger with burnt bacon and 4 bite sized bits of potato with an awkward arrangement of grapes and strawberries.

My boyfriend ordered their crabcake eggs benedict which came with fully poached eggs (no runny yolk), cold crabcakes, and dried out asparagus. We're not picky people and we never send food back to the kitchen, ever.

The manager came around and we both hesitated when she asked us how everything was. We explained what happened with our order and it was clear we hadn't eaten much of our brunch. Without even blinking she said she would replace our meal and that it would be comped. I've never seen such instant customer service. The food that replaced our original dish was night and day, it was like different people had cooked it.

Went on a busy Saturday night. After missing our reservation due to traffic, the hostess helped us to get seated right away. That was awesome. The restaurant is beautiful. We were told that the menu was new this weekend. Everything looked good, so maybe the menu is a bit too big, but that's not really a problem. After looking over the menu for a few minutes, the waitress came over to give us a ""tour"" of the menu. Dear Doc M's: This is not people's first time eating in a restaurant. No one needs a tour of the menu.

Ordered some oysters, which were FANTASTIC! Loved the Shooting Points-had never tried those before. Then the waitress came back to give us a tour of the menu (yes-another one). Remember, by this point, we had had menus for almost 20 minutes. We cut her off and told her we were ready to order. It took about 25 minutes for apps to come out. The clam chowder, a special this month, had a great flavor profile, but was definitely too thick, and for a $9 caesar salad, it was way too small. Entrees were very good, but definitely on the small side. Lobster roll was NOT served on buttered brioche, but instead on a small hoagie roll with bland fries. Grilled and blackened swordfish were both delicious. 

In the future, I think we would definitely go back, because the food was very good.

First things first, I really wanted to like this place: Its in a great location in West Chester, has outdoor seating, great oyster selection, and is one of the few exclusive seafood restaurants in the area (I love seafood).

We went here in a group of 7 for my good friend's girlfriend's birthday.

Sat at the bar for drinks waiting for the rest of the party, bartender was friendly and beers are beers.

As the other people arrived we were seated immediately in the back corner.

While the waitress was friendly, she was clearly new, and not trained very well. She did not know the specials, or the drink policy of the day (let us order an unavailable drink for that day).

I ordered 2 apps, a pound of sauteed littleneck clams, and half dozen oyster on the half.

First the clams: Portion was skimpy, barely a dozen. Clams were cooked properly but were very gritty, broth was over-reduced and way too salty.

Oysters: The waitress got my order wrong and gave me 2 of the wrong kind. no big deal. But the quality of the oysters were sub-par at best. The guy shucking the oysters had no idea of what he was doing; they were mangled, i mean like he stuck the knife into the oyster, blended it, pried it open, poured the liquor out and threw it on a metal pan, with jarred cocktail sauce, and a lemon. There was barely half the oyster left. At practically $3 a piece, i was disappointed. 

I ordered the crab cake sandwich as a main. The waitress got the order wrong, and I received the crab cake entree. Sent it back, came back to me on a stale bun (the one crab cake from the previous plate), was cold, tasted of being previously frozen, and definitely canned crab meat, and now included a side of frozen french fries.

I shook my head as a got the bill and signed the $70 check (just for my food and drink).

The place looks great on the outside with a classic oyster house feel. Inside is dimly-lit and welcoming, with a warm and friendly staff. I always order a dozen of their raw clams. Clams have more taste and texture than oysters, they are absolutely divine. Then dozens of raw oysters are ordered from their ample daily selections menu. If I do order something on the side, it would usually just be fries or the peel 'n eat shrimp. Just something little, the oysters are the main attraction.

Calamari was good - plump and tender.  It was downhill from there.  

Shrimp cocktail was mushy and a bit ""iffy"" on the freshness.

Seared scallops were scorched and had a really bad burnt taste because of it.  

Lobster roll was terrible.  Way over dressed.  Drowning in a terrible sour, runny mayo sauce.  I think the lobster was frozen, not fresh.  The lobster was diced very small.  I think all the sauce and the small cut were an attempt to cover up that it wasn't good lobster to begin with.

My husband ate only one of his scallops.  I ate only a bite of my lobster roll.  When clearing our plates, the waitress asked if everything was OK.  I explained that I didn't like the lobster roll.  She came back with a complimentary shot glass of pudding as a consolation prize for the terrible dinner.  I politely turned it down.  The check came and included my $22 lobster roll.  A manager never stopped by to ask us about our concerns.  The waitress was very good and attentive other than not taking care of the issue at the end of the meal.

There was no wait got seated right away and the waiter was very friendly. The menu is a sheet of paper with lots of options, mostly seafood though, my favorite.

For an appitizer we got the cease and desist fries which were fries with crab and cheese fondue over them. The fries were the perfect crispiness and the fondue was a thick, semi chunky cheese sauce. it tasted like crab but didn't actually taste crab chunks at all so must have been very finely chopped up. It was different but really good.

For my entree i decided to get the fresh fish catch. you get to pick from 7 types of fish, pick the way you want it cooked and then pick the suace you want over it. I got Mahi Mahi grilled with lemon butter sauce. There was a good size of fish grilled perfectly but unfortunately i wasn't a fan of the sauce, too much lemon for me so i just scraped it off. My meal also came with mashed potatoes and a vegetable. Masked potatoes were amazing and the vegetable was cut up squash, zucchini, peppers, and snap peas cooked in some type of sauce. they were good, not overcooked.

My friend got the surf and turf with a 6 oz filet and crab cake. the filet was the perfect size and looked like it cut very easily. unfortunately she asked for medium well and it was more medium so had to send it back. The crab cake was good, i know because i tasted it lol. Her meal also came with the potato and vegetables.

The mussels were incredible. The red sauce had a light garlic taste that did not over power the taste of the mussels-excellent!

I had the linguini fra diovalo as my main course. Generous portions of shrimp, scallops and calamari. It was delicious but I prefer it with a hotter kick. Just a personal preference.

The band was great, totally got people moving. When they were taking a break, they played a mix-music-video set that was surprisingly really good and even got my boyfriend dancing (the transitions between songs were really good...I'm all about transitions lol)
Definitely come here for the $5 fish bowls, $3 soco lime shots, music, and service. You also have the option to sit down with your drink and chill with friends before getting up to get rowdy. Don't come here for food unless you got some green to spend.

We finished with oyster shooters - perfect combo of lemon vodka, cocktail sauce and fresh oyster. And could not help it but get some of their frozen desserts - cookies and cream for me and cream and raspberries for my husband.

687,4.0,"My wife and I went here for an early Valentines day dinner and we had a great time.

First the good. The food and drinks were excellent. The beer menu was a little on the shorter side, but they had a nice variety of draft and bottled beer, My wife ordered an alcoholic lemonade (the name escapes me) which I tasted and I can say it was dangerously good. We started with a half perfect storm which is raw clams and oysters crab and shrimp. It was pretty decent considering how far inland we are (although my clams were slightly gritty.) 

For my entree I got the sirloin/ crab cake combo. The steak was delicious, definitely a quality cut of meat. The crab cake was slightly bland but the sauce really helped to pep it up. The sides were excellent and complimented the food nicely. My wife had the scallops which I can say were pretty damn good (and I'm not a scallops fan.) Desserts were tasty but small we ended up getting ice cream on the way home to satisfy the sweet tooth. 

The atmosphere was really nice. It has a friendly, old-world, everything is handmade look to it, but both the restaurant and the bathrooms were very clean. The temperature in the restaurant was great (it was a very cold day) but the bathrooms were frigid. There decor consisted of old and new pictures and knickknacks and really helped to enhance the ambiance.

Now for the bad. Our server was, there's no other word for it, incompetent. We had to ask for our water and he didn't remember to get it until after our appetizer was on the table, he did not know the specials and had to go ask his manager several very basic questions about the menu. It sometimes took several minutes for him to go get us something as simple as a refill. My wife's dish was missing one of it's sides and when she pointed that out he said ""I was wondering about that"". I really think he was upset because we interrupted him hitting on the new bartender and it showed in his service.  Frankly he is the only reason that Doc's isn't rated five stars.

Stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago and had a nice time.  The seafood lovers enjoyed their choices - mahi tacos, some kind of seafood chowder, a salad with four different kinds of seafood on it, and of course, some oysters.  

There weren't many choices for me and my other daughter who is a vegetarian, but we enjoyed the vegetarian linguine provencal dish that we both got.  It was yummy and chock full of some of my faves - roasted tomatoes, kalamata olives, asparagus and tons and tons of capers.  It was a nice size but for the price I would have liked to have gotten a side salad for just a few bucks more, instead of the $8 apiece we had to shell out for salads that consisted of just mixed greens, tomatoes, cukes and a few radishes. 

At $110 including the tip, it was probably THE most expensive lunch we've ever had (luckily the gift card cut that almost in half) so considering the prices, the location (a bit out of the way for me), and the fact that there are literally only 3-4 non-seafood lovers can eat there, I highly doubt we'll ever go there again.

For entrees, they have a wide variety of seafood options to chose from. For those who do not like seafood, there are poultry and meat options as well... oh, and salads too! I ordered the grilled scallops (options are: blackened, herb butter or herb gremolata) and I chose the herb gremolata. Delicious!! The scallops were succulant and fresh. My mom ordered the scallops blackened I liked them even more! They are paired with cauliflower mash, roasted fingerling potatoes and string beans. You can also order salmon, mahi-mahi, yellowfin tuna, tilapia, shrimp or the catch of the day prepared this way, and paired with those same sides or sub a salad instead.

Went with a few friends for my birthday dinner, we called ahead to ask for an outdoor table at 7- they said they could accommodate us at 7:30. When we arrived at 7:25, they did not have any outdoor seating for us and it would be at least a 20 minute wait. We decided to sit inside. 

It was a normal dinner rush that evening, nothing crazier than normal. All four in my party ordered wine, we did not receive our drinks until AFTER our appetizers. From there on, it was even more disappointing. The server never asked during our meal if everything was fine, the manager that night was walking around and was going to every table but ours to see if they were okay. We waited for about 10-15 minutes with out empty dinner plates in front of us until our server finally came back around- where we were able to order only our second drinks. At the end, we said something to our waiter of how disappointed we were. His response was that there was not enough wine glasses that night. He never got the manager to come over and to talk to us.

Penn State reunion at a friend's housewarming party in WC. Daylonging beforehand, and finally making it out to the bar around...9pm? 10? Umm...

This place smells like fish when you walk in. Or, rather like a fish tank that needs a good scrub. Upstairs bar = much better. Apparently the thing to get here is Fishbowls, which is basically one of those plastic fishbowls (imagine that.) filled with liquor and mixers. They remind me of the fishbowls at Bar Bleu in State College. My only issue is, just like at my favorite Penn State bar, you are  likely to get diabetes following consumption of this concoction. The blinking lights everywhere was a nice touch.

I ended up ordering Diet Cokes and water here though, since the last thing I needed at this point was more booze. However, just because I don't need something, doesn't mean I didn't want it....

She had the mixed plate with salmon, scallops, and shrimp.  Everything was cooked well and delicious.

Besides that, the atmosphere is wonderful and the food has been consistently tasty. They have two fun oyster drinks as well: Slurp-a-burp which is an Oyster with cocktail sauce and lager or the Oyster shooter which is the same, but with vodka.

The oysters I've gotten there have been high quality and good-tasting. For the squeamish - I've never gotten sick. And on top of that the other dishes have been delightful.

The only problem I've had is that some nights they don't have enough people shucking the oysters which can cause really really slow service.

Beyond that though, it's all downhill. The most recent time I went, we sat for twenty minutes before our server remembered we were there. We ordered 24 oysters and calamari since we knew the oysters would take long time to come out. We ended up getting the oysters before the calamari. That's the thing about buck a shuck, expect to wait 20 to 30 for those oysters to come out, especially if you order a bunch all at once like I do.

Calamari was good but there were banana peppers breaded and fried in there with the squid so I kept getting a mouthful of Dear God No.

I haven't ordered food there since I went for ""brunch"" and left so hungry I went next door to eat. I ordered eggs Benedict but got eggs on uncooked English muffins with some ham and so little hollandaise sauce it literally looked like it came out of McDonald's ketchup packet. 

I mean it, one whole muffin didn't have any at All. What kind of eggs Benedict doesn't have any hollandaise sauce? 

Between that and never having what I try to order in stock (take it off the menu if it's so difficult to keep!) I see no point in counting on Doc's on anything beyond cheap oysters.

I should have heeded the other poor Yelp reviews that I had read & selected a different restaurant.  If you are contemplating going to this restaurant with children; please note this review as a cautionary tale.

Reservation was at 2pm & we were seated promptly & the table selection was perfect as we were placed in our own little section away from the rest of the crowd (this was a nice touch).  Everything went down hill from here.  We put in the kids orders (2 macaroni & cheeses, 1 crabby patty & 1 chicken tenders) within 10 minutes of sitting down.  An hour later, after 3 prompting conversations with our nice enough waiter; the kids' orders finally came out.  This was a consistent theme throughout the experience; nothing came to our table without continued prompting & near begging.  Our 2 appetizers came out 1.5 hours after sitting down.  Finally, our 3 entrees came out; nearly 2 hours after sitting down.  Again, nothing came to our table until I requested/complained/implored the waiter to please bring something to the table.  

The food varied; most of the plates were pretty good, grilled salmon, crab cake sandwich, lobster blt tacos, & calimari; however; the east steamer pot; both the crab & mussels must have been sitting & over-steaming; just as we did the same....the crab & mussels were completely overdone & was a similar experience to chewing on your tongue.

Friends and I met up here to take advantage of their attractive Monday specials[1]: their ""Buck-a-Shuck"" special meant raw oysters were a mere $1. We indulged in half-off appetizers, $4 classic mojitos - surprisingly good, with a kick - and $1 PBRs.

At the bar, bartender Mario[2] paid a lot of attention to us. Shared a huge, awesometastic assortment of thirty (30) oysters, trying about EIGHT different varieties, freshly shucked in front of us, and were some of the best I've had in recent memory. While sklorking them down, we watched the Olympics on flat screen TVs, then washed everything down with a few oyster shooters full of vodka. Mmmm.

Doc Magrogan's has lots of seating, and outdoor tables too. As more folks showed up, we were corralled into a side dining room. Meghan, our brave, sole server, somehow managed to serve the twenty of us.

I'll be back to Doc Magrogan's for their oyster specials, just not to sit at a table - at least, not with such a gargantuan party. Check them out, and tell them Dave sent you[3].

The crabs tasted as though there were boiled in plain tap water, no seasoning, no lemon juice or salt, NOTHING! When I mentioned this I was rewarded with a cup of dry Old Bay seasoning.

 We didn't bother w seconds but ordered the apple strudel for dessert. Of course there wasn't a teaspoon of ice cream to be had.we were brought sliced apples wrapped in phyllo dough, again with minimal seasoning or flavor.

734,1.0,I would go lower than one star if I could. They don't clean anything in there. I went there and had three drinks and was throwing up for 7 hours. They don't clean their soda lines and I doubt they clean much else. If they don't care about the health of their customers they don't deserve to even be open.

In the past the downstairs tends to be the older crowd with the upstairs being considerably younger.  We decided to stay downstairs and we here for about 3 hours or so.  I've never ordered food here and probably never will, but I did see a fair amount of people with food at the bar.  This is the most down to earth, unpretentious sports bars around.

738,1.0,"Really rude and unprofessional management here.

Long story short, Im 23 and lost my license once so I have a duplicate ID, which understandably gives reason to request secondary identification. Bars usually will accept a credit/debit card, college ID, or have you recite your information to them, but that was not satisfactory for the bouncer here and I had to leave.

Understandable. A job is a job, and I'm all for giving second chances. He told me something with a picture and a date of birth is required, so next week I showed up with my current, valid US Passport.

Nope! Denied again. Funny thing, the bouncer said if I was a non-american he could accept my passport as valid ID.

This was upsetting cause I'm tired of going to the same bars in my town. I decided to call and speak with the owner/manager the next day. I explained my situation and asked what exactly is required for a person in my situation with a duplicate ID? She said the ONLY thing they would accept is an expired license, which I did not have, so I would not be allowed in. No passports no birth certificates no nothing.

To add salt to the burn, when I mentioned how I felt it was an unreasonable policy and will be discouraging friends from going as a result, she (the owner) said ""You do what you want, Fuck you"" then hung up.

Well, obviously I'm not gunna leave a positive review after this experience.

742,2.0,"Went out for a beer with a family member. Figured we'd give Sharkey's a try. The bartender was a bit rude, as if she was rushed to give us our beers when the bar was not really that busy. When we sat to drink them I quickly noticed why. She was busy dancing, singing, and shaking her butt in an attempt to get a good tip from two men who were there.
I understand when a bar is busy and buzzing you may have to flag down the bartender to refresh your drink. My company wanted another beer and instead of being aware of the patrons she waited over 5 minutes to get her attention to get another beer. Ridiculous. She acted as if it was a bother to have to do her job!
I hear the food here is great. I do plan to go back at least one more time to try their food. Hopefully service will be better this time.
I also noticed how unkept the woman's room was... Sure, people write on the walls and it's an adult establishment, but I would embarrassed to own a place with such awful things written ALL over the stalls in the bathroom. Not to mention there was toilet paper all over the floor and it seemed a bit dirty. On a busy night I can understand the bathroom being overlooked a bit, but not one employee stepped into the bathroom the whole time we were there to even check if it needed to be cleaned a bit. It made it seem that this is the norm. I'd hate to have to be there on a busy night! I couldn't imagine how gross it gets when it's actually busy if thats what it's like when it's not. 
It was also a cold, icy night when we visited and the parking lot was very poorly salted. There were give ice spots near and on the walk way, as well. Very dangerous, especially with inebriated people leaving. I wouldn't be surprised if someone falls and gets seriously hurt one day. If the owners are reading this please do a better salt job in the winter months. People are sue happy now a days.
Thumbs up for use music. I have to say it was a decent variety and more to my taste. No hip hop/rap. Stuck to the classics and that was the best part of my experience there.

746,4.0,"Of all the Williamstown bars, Sharky's has the youngest most rock orientated crowd.  That's what really makes the place special.  Otherwise, its a decent neighborhood bar - not quite the dive others describe it as, though you'l never mistake it for an elitist establishment.  

The bar is spread between two floors.  Downstairs has a corner bar vibe, upstairs more of a sports bar.  The bar also has a deck upstairs.   Like the other bars in the area, Sharky's opted to put ""good looking girl"" ahead of ""fast and attentive"" in their qualifications for bar tender, though the service isn't bad.  Unlike House of Brews, Taylors, and Geets, the bar tenders are more milfy hot than out of your league tart hot.   Ordinary beer prices are what you would expect for a bar of this kind. The beer specials tend to be on nasty Coors.  They frequently have booze brand reps giving away trinkets.  

 But in the end, its the crowd and the music choice is what makes the place.  Bob and Doug's is ghetto.  Geets is more middle age and kind of lame.  House of brews is older and more stuffy.  Taylors is d-bag central.  But Sharky's is a house full of rocker kids.  Since that's my style (even if I'm a little old for it), that makes Sharky's the place for me.",8rb-3VYXE37IZix4yOdskw,Sharky's Sports Bar & Grill,Williamstown,2.5,-74.9998214,39.6968014,"American (Traditional), Bars, Nightlife, Sports Bars, Restaurants",,820 N Black Horse Pike,NJ

The atmosphere inside this place was awful, there wasn't even music playing except the occasional song that someone put on the jukebox. No sort of entertainment at all. The bartender working that night had to be chased down numerous times, and she took our orders by screaming at us from across the room rather than coming over to us.

760,4.0,"Went here for a Saturday night out to catch some sports and listen to some live music (which was going on from 5-8). 
The place was pretty crowded in the bar area, not so much on the table/restaurant side. 
Our Waitress Jess was very nice and helpful. It seems as though many people there knew each other which indicates there is a local element to the place which is fine, they obviously have a base clientele. 
We started with a few appetizers, the cheese steak egg rolls were good however one of them was a little overdone. They had good flavor with a little spicy kick. The other appetizer was a fried seafood sampler with Calamari, Shrimp and Clams Casino. This was very good and cooked to perfection with a nice portion. 
We decided to split a meal since we were pretty full from the appetizers. We went with the Chicken Marsala and again the portion size was generous. The Marsala sauce was tasty as were the green beans and mashed potatoes that came with the dish. No big complaints about the food. 
The noise level in the place is pretty high, probably because the place is wide open. This noise was apparent even when the live musician was playing. There was a DJ that started at 9 and he did a great job of mixing up the music genres. The crowd really picked up around 10 and the age group of the crowd was pretty diverse but leaned toward the 20/30's group. 
Overall this seems like a fun place to hang out or have dinner. The noise level is high so if you're looking for quiet/intimate then this isn't you're place. 
I will add that since it is winter we found the restaurant seating area to be pretty cold. There are 2 exit/entry doors on that side of the building and every time the door opened the cold air rushed in and there was no protection from it. The heat didn't appear to on very high so the cold drafts made it tough. We actually moved tables once to avoid the cold from the door opening.

Got the mussels appetizer which was great - tasted fresh and was smothered in a delicious white wine broth. I opted for the crab cakes which were full of lump crab meat and not a lot of filling. They were fantastic. It came with mashed potatoes and veggies, as well as a tasty, basic starter salad.

I went to order their main featured burger off the menu, but they were out of the cheese for the burger.  Strike 2

I ended up ordering a ""Specialty Sandwich"", the Chicken Inner Harbor -Boneless Chicken Breast Sauteed in Olive Oil w/Garlic, Roasted Peppers, Sauteed Spinach & Smoked Mozzarella.  The bottom of the bun was completely soaked, Chicken was very bland and it had a hint of Smoke.  The spinach was probably the only decent part and you could detect slight garlic.  $9 was a bit on the high side for what you get.  Fries were $1.75 additional.  Strike 3

$8 for a 10oz pour of craft beer outside the City is on the high side as well.  

Hard to excuse a poorly made sandwich at all, but when only three people are in the establishment during prime lunch time with a whopping three food orders, that's pretty bad.  The server was a nice young girl and that is why there's an extra star. I'm one for giving a place a second try, but I'll pass and spend my money elsewhere.

I didn't come in with high expectations. Bars on Mac Dade Blvd aren't always known for food quality. I was content with a simple sandwich and a beer. 

The menu itself is rather basic. It's heavy on sandwiches, appetizers, burgers, and cheesesteaks. But yesterday they had two items on special that caught my eye. The French Onion soup and New Orleans chicken sandwich seemed like a good combo. 

The soup surprised me. It had a nice amount of cheese along with good flavor in the broth. My expectations suddenly were raised. 

The sandwich was huge. It was overloaded with chicken and cheese and had a great Cajun bite to it. Most importantly it was juicy. Grilled chicken sandwiches often dry out. This one was perfect.

The dining room consists of many tables and two booths.  There is also an outdoor seating area that feels like it's part of the parking lot.

They have a version of mozzarella sticks that are a must try.  They're more like two slabs of cheese fried and then smothered in marinara sauce with basil and parmesan sprinkled on top.  Very good and you can use the extra sauce to dip the complimentary bread in.

The menu lacks flavor on all things but their marinara sauce.  The marinara sauce is not too sweet, not too tomatoey, not too bitter.  The fettuccine alfredo is bland and requires lots of red peppers.  The mozzarella prosciutto sandwich is my favorite thing on the menu, the bread is soft with a firm crust, the meats and cheeses are only alright at best, but the mustard-mayonnaise sauce gives it a nice kick.

I can't resist cannoli's.  They have them here, and for $6 you can get something that looks like a cannoli, is called a cannoli, but is filled with cream instead of cheese.

787,3.0,"This was a 2nd choice as our first choice in Tucson proper was packed.

I had the spaghetti with meat sauce which was pretty decent. It was a homemade sauce with lots of meat and even chunks of real tomatoes in it. The sauce was not sickeningly sweet and actually tasted pretty decent.

The bread was fresh on the table and the cold antipasti was excellent. Salads were fresh and not from a bag and the dressings were decent.

A loud atmosphere inside and the crowding of the tables inside would be the only downfall. Also, they sat a party of four at a table that at most could fit 2 comfortably.

Service was decent, but not exceptional. There were times our table of four was ignored but drinks seemed to be refilled on a regular basis. Hostess staff was not impressive and seemed to be bored or uninterested and seemed to spend most of the time flirting with the waiters as they ran their tickets next to the host staff.

From my two local Tucson natives, this location is better than the one on Broadway I believe.

I wanted this to be a 4* review but due to the few shortcomings it will have to remain at 3. Not good for groups due to the small, crammed together tables and relatively few booths.

Like any sports bar you can watch any sport on any of the many TV's they have. You can also watch hockey/figure skating/curling/public skating in person while dining or having a drink. Then if all of that watching gets you motivated you can go and do it at the same place! 

There is a full bar including many craft beers and the owners very own tap of 81bay's beers. There is also many other local Tampa brews on tap! 

As for the food, many are surprised that this is not your average sports food there is a nice diversity and there are many healthy options and divulgent options too for any diet or preference. The food may take a bit longer wait than expected but that is only because almost everything is made fresh from scratch in the kitchen. There is a snack bar owned by the same owners downstairs in the rink if you are more in a hurry.

Their menu has influences like Ybor City for the Ybor Eggrolls, Canadian Hockey traditional Poutine dishes, and a Tampa Bay Lightning Bleu Burger. They have a small kids menu and the whole restaurant including the bar is Kid-friendly. The chef is an amazing person who sometimes comes out to talk to customers as are all the staff including the owners, bartenders, hostess, servers, and kitchen staff.

My significant other had the Classic Burger that was well seasoned. I will definitely be coming back here really soon.

First visit was a Tuna Bowl. Absolutely perfect seared tuna over a big bowl of rice. Lots of wonton chips. Was miserably full, but couldn't stop eating (my problem, not theirs). 

Two visits over the winter. Tried different angus burgers. Delivered as promised. 

Finally tried the ""brisket bender"".  Absolutely delicious, but more of a pot roast texture. Maybe I am just to hungry for a truly objective review.  I don't care what cut of beef it is, I can't stop eating.

In case you didn't know, Top Shelf is located on the second level w/views of two hockey rings - this is one of the coolest discoveries, especially if your kids are at hockey practice/game.

823,5.0,"So tonight I had the pleasure of dining in Top Shelf Sports Lounge. Now a few days prior I did the delivery route and it was not what my fellow Yelpers been writing about. After tonight I definitely can say I must Retract my last review. 

Everyone deserves a second chance and tonight was that chance. I met one of the owners (Ray) along with an AMAZING STAFF and the genius master creator of their food the Chef. 

For starters, we had the top shelf chips and the Bruddah Rays Ahi Tuna Stack. The chips were yummy but what separated these chips from everyone else was the Balsamic drizzle. I swear if I did not ask the waitress to take the plate away I would've still been indulging my mouth with these chips. Now the Ahi Tuna Stack was a masterpiece of art within itself so dope that you do not want to destroy it. But once you get the courage to do so the taste is an epic experience. The wonton strips along with the ponzu sauce will keep you wanting more.

My children had the kids mac & cheese, kept them happy that we even took home the leftovers. Now my entreé for the evening was the Top shelf Wings. Hands down the best freaking wings I came across since living in Tampa. I thought Union 72 BBQ had good wings. Not no more! 

The thing about being a reviewer is the truthfulness we write on what we ate or tried at an establishment. What made me go and try Top Shelf in person this evening was the fact that the owner reached out to me. This showed me on how much pride they take in the food they prep and deliver to their consumers. Any establishment that wants to show me, a reviewer that I was wrong, is a place that I can respect. 

I left here with a full belly and already planning my next visit along with family and friends. Kudos to Joe and Ray along with the Top Shelf Sports Lounge staff.

Judging the price of the menu, it is about 10% more than regular restaurant. However we were no regrets that because the food measured up with the price we paid. It still has some bump to iron out, our waitress is still don't know which beer is happy hours. They offer happy hours item from 4 pm to 7 pm Monday to Friday. The app is 25% off from the pregame section. The draft beer is $2 off. 

We started with Ybor egg roll. It has mojo pork, ham and salami wrap together. Who can resist it. I also get the tuna bowl. It seared blacken Ahi tuna over rice and Asian slaw. It has the honey soy ginger sauce. It was quite good. Lastly we have the Top Shelf wings. This is must have item. It is about $0.20 more than normal outside restaurant wing place. However, it worth the money. This wing is marinated in mojo sauce, then grill over the open flame and top with the house sauce. It was delicious.

Can I just say that the house style wings was one of the BEST tasting wings I ever had and In my opinion it is the BEST in WESLEY CHAPEL. 

They are grilled not fried so it's not greasy at all. They were marinated overnight so they are very flavorful. Delicious!!! When you can eat the wings without needing any ranch or blue cheese, I call that a WINNER! 

SN: it is more expensive that other wing related restaurants in the area if you compare prices but it's sooooo good!

Other than that, it's located in a ice skating arena. It's not uncomfortably cold in the restaurant.

She loved it and my wife is very hard to please so kudos to the chef at the Top Shelf Sports Lounge. For my boys simple and a basic rice and beans. Nothing fancy about it they were okay with it but not the best rice and beans they had. Lastly, for myself, I ordered the Thunder chop chop bowl which I wanted to love. But due to a sufficient amount of burnt rice in the dish, they fell short of receiving my love. 

Definitely willing to try them again this time in-house. So until I make it over there this rating will stand. Everyone deserves a second chance to prove themselves.

I tried the tuna bowl and Havana bowl, both tasted excellent. The tuna bowl has slices of seared blackened tuna and the Havana bowl has mojo roast pork.  Prices and quality are great.

859,1.0,"If you can't handle a miscommunication and resulting frustration without resorting to mocking and laughing at your customers, you probably shouldn't be in business. 

We gave this place one more go after a couple inconsistencies throughout 8 or 9 orders (missing ingredients a few times, wait times for to go always seemed like our food had been sitting way too long - plus usually nobody out front, they all hang out in the kitchen)...honestly when the food was good, it was really really good, ya know? 

Too bad we chanced it again and had the same issues today, thankfully we caught it at the car and went back inside to recover 2 missing ingredients. They took care of the quinoa for my boyfriend's salad but said the avocados they had weren't ripe enough yet, and both entrees listed avocado. Somehow this wasn't noted by anyone or relayed to us while ordering. My boyfriend asked for some sort of compensation for that and the instances before - not a full refund, just to help with the repetitive inconveniences. Note that we never asked for a full refund, at any point...

Somehow the manager could not comprehend this. He offered to take back the food and then grabbed the bag from me, and I snatched it back because we had already paid and he refused to hear us out. I simply didn't want to return my food after being told a 25 minute wait time that seemed horribly inaccurate given the sparse state of the restaurant. 

What resulted was a bit of chaos and confusion. Everyone got more frustrated trying to get to the source of the problem then he began mocking us as I explained our experiences in the past, quoting my words back and laughing. He couldn't understand why we would come back if we had noticed anything wrong to begin with. The reason was me giving them the benefit of the doubt because anyone who's worked in restaurants knows that it can be variable and stressful... Joke's on us though as proven by his incredulous laughter, followed by ""I'll just get you the full refund. I know what kind of people you are and what you want."" 

At that point I felt we're dealing with a personal bias more than anything else. He would rather pay $30 back to us to be rude and unapologetic, rather than admit any fault or discuss the matter logically. Also, when someone says ""I've been in the restaurant business for years"" as a defense tactic when I ask why I'm being laughed at... it doesn't give them credibility. It feels like pulling at straws because they don't know the right way to handle a lack of communication from their employees.

875,5.0,"My girlfriends picked Top Shelf for dinner on our June 2021 Girls' Night. Though I thought this was a really random choice, the location is fairly convenient off of I-75 and an easy spot to meet since we were coming from different directions. Because this Friday night was also Game 7 of the Lightning series vs the Islanders, one of the girls made reservations for us.

Parking was insane! It seemed like a skating session was ending but people were lingering; eventually I found a spot after about 10 minutes of circling. By the time I made it up to the second floor & found my girls, it was several minutes after 7pm and they already had a table & drinks.

I'll note now that our server was incredibly attentive. Even though the restaurant was packed & very busy, she checked on us frequently. Once I arrived, she was quick to come over & get my drink order. And when another girl arrived, our server noticed almost immediately & again was promptly at our table.

One of my friends ordered the Ybor Egg Rolls to share and they were amazing! I definitely could've made a meal of this appetizer. They were fun twist on the Cuban sandwich flavors we all know - incredibly tasty & generously filled. The same friend also raved about the wings she'd ordered (& has ordered on prior visits) but I'm not a wing fan so I'll just share that she loves the wings & highly recommends them. 

I ordered the Brisket Bender Bowl and LOVED it. The mashed potatoes were not overly garlicky and the brisket was super tender & flavorful. I was eating on this for days!

So, yes, Top Shelf is not obviously located, and is slightly more challenging to visit, but they have some really great food. I was drinking Bud Light with dinner on this night (pacing myself), but one of my girls enjoyed a cocktail & another had a sangria. No one was disappointed.

The prior reviews raved about the wings but we were not particularly a fan.. they were pretty big and the appearance and texture didn't look all the way cooked.

The surly drink maker looked at me like I had roaches coming out my eyes when I went up to her and asked if this were my latte, can I just have it while I wait in line, so nobody mistakes it for theirs and takes it?

I know the Wawa rules but it wasn't like I was gonna book it out the door as soon as I got my $3 coffee. Instead, this lady does not give me the coffee and rudely tells me ""why don't you go back and wait in line"" with such a nasty attitude it took all my might not to tell her to f off. 

So I waited in the long time. While I was waiting, a guy went up to the coffee counter, looking a little confused, and took my latte off the counter.

I'm not dealing with this. I left the line and went over to the 38th street Wawa. Had my coffee and out the door within 5 minutes. 

Anyway like I said, I knew the rules and ""broke them"" but really, I don't look like a thief.

I find that there is very little not to like about this Wawa. Yeah, they could stock a few more cereals and I really wish they carried Double Stuf Oreos, but they can't have everything... Because then they'd be a grocery store. 

I also wish that I didn't order gross sandwiches while drunk so often, but that's not exactly their fault... Though perhaps they should consider adding a confirmation page that asks, ""Are you sure, dummy?"" when you order something greasy and gross between midnight and 4am.

930,4.0,"I recently went to Philly because I wanted a good cheesesteak.  Tony Luke's was alright but  I think Wawa was a lot better value for the money.  We don't have Wawa in NY so I really wanted to see if the hoagies were as good as I read about.  This particular Wawa in the UPenn area was pretty nondescript.  Inside it looked like a bigger and better version of 7-11.  

I ended up getting an Italian hero because it seemed pretty basic and a good baseline for the Wawa experience.  I got it with a little bit of oil and vinegar.  It was the 10 inch version and the total came out to $7.01.  I was blown away by the price because I don't think you can find a full Italian hero in NY for less than like $10 minimum.  Of course you can't compare Wawa to a genuine Italian hero but still.  

I took the hoagie to a nearby Panera Bread and ate it there.  The hoagie wasn't the biggest sub ever, but it was decently sized.  I believe they put ham and salami in there along with lettuce, onions, and provolone.  

The experience of eating this thing was pretty interesting.  Because there is nothing really special about the hoagie and it's far from the best sandwich ever.  However, it was just so solid for the price.  There was nothing spectacular about the hoagie, but also nothing glaringly offensive about it either.  All in all, it was a really enjoyable eat.  The bread was fairly chewy.  The cold cuts were pretty tasty.  The provolone went well with the cold cuts.  The hoagie was just so easy to continue biting into.  After I finished it I had a bigass smile on my face.  

I was so happy with my Wawa hoagie that I stopped off at another Wawa on my way home and got a 6 inch Meatball hoagie ($4.89 total).  That was also pretty solid too.  I also got a medium coffee ($1.65) and 2 kit kats for $2.

946,4.0,"TL;DR verdict: lovely little place with good food.

Atmosphere: decorations were an interesting mix of tacky and elegant. The music was not the usual generic random-Asian-string-instrument, but J-pop! And artists I actually knew, such as X Japan and Hamasaki Ayumi.

Service: attentive, polite, helpful.

And the food! Yummy. (Yes, I went there.) I ordered an $11 three-roll sushi lunch, with East, Spicy Salmon and Eel Rolls. All were delicious, I didn't even need to wasabi or soy sauce. My friends ordered the cheaper yakisoba and shrimp tempura lunches, which were ""quite good"" and ""great"" respectively. The tempura breading was also ""fabulous"" but the sauce that came with it too vinegary. All lunch specials came with miso soup and salad, which were not outstanding, but satisfying.

Two appetizers, yakitori and beef negimaki, were also enjoyed. Great char on the bottom of the negimaki, and the presentation was fun. We only received two skewers of yakitori, sadly, and had to divide them; the chicken was somewhat bland but the vegetables (green peppers, mushrooms, onions) made up for it.

After our food was finished, or packed up in doggy bags (stapled even! how nice of them) we were handed a complimentary plate of fried(?) breaded(?) banana drizzled in lime(?) green sauce. Well, whatever it was, I ate most of it. Beautiful texture and flavor, especially with their lovely whipped cream.

Even after all that, we ordered a dessert to share- they have quite the selection! Thus, the deliciously decadent chocolate truffle, sized somewhat like a tennis ball. Composed of gelato and cocoa dusting, among other things, and topped with more of that whipped cream and a cherry- mmmmm.

947,2.0,"It's hard to say how much I like the place because I base it on what I've had before and my favorites are in Central/North Jersey. I haven't found a great sushi place in South Jersey and I may or may not go back to this one because I'd like to try out a few other places.

The atmosphere is a little tacky, the music makes me feel like I want to fall asleep, but it seemed pretty clean. It took a little while for us to sit and order, there was only one girl working and one guy making the food. Nothing special on the service, not rude but not overly friendly.

Food was good. I didn't get sushi, I got the vegetable hibachi and my boyfriend got a few vegetarian rolls. He enjoyed the cucumber & avocado and sweet potato roll, the squash roll isn't the typical squash we were expecting so I don't think that was one he really liked. The hibachi was good- green peppers, onions, carrots, broccoli all mixed on a plate with sauce and a side of fried rice. A little plain. Soup and salad comes with it, salad was good, the clear soup-not as good as I was hoping, I didn't eat much of it, it tasted a little off.

Overall a decent place to eat. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but I won't kick and scream if I go back to eat.",NZ_bFJma7brQUfln5h1UAg,Super Sushi Kyo Hin,Burlington,3.5,-74.8258209,40.0416285,"Restaurants, Japanese, Sushi Bars, Asian Fusion",,2501 Mt Holly Rd 245,NJ

I didn't think much of this place when I first saw it, I did however, went in and asked for a take-home menu.  Yesterday my girl and I went to try it out.  Hands down, this place have one of the best sushi I've ever tried anywhere.  Not only does it taste good but their plating is amazing.  The chef hand drawn a whole dragon with eel sauce and the  Hawaiian roll came out with flashing lights on the actual plate.  I know someone mentioned this before in their review but it's really that amazing when you see it in person.  If you want sushi, this is the place to be.  I haven't really tried their hot food but the salmon hibachi I got wasn't all that.  The hibachi came with fried rice and two shrimps.  The shrimps were pretty good (that's what my girl told me) but the dish itself had too sauce for a hibachi.  The fried rice isn't all that either.

The bread was delicious,  the sopressata sandwich was divine, as was the green bean artichoke salad.  I was surprised and disappointed that the salad was not accompanied by 1-2 small slices of the baguette. When asked, the server said I could order a 1/2 loaf of the baguette (which I did), though that ended up being just too much.   Also, I would recommend not slicing the whole 1/2 loaf, rather, just make the single cut and leave it to the customer to tear it apart....

987,5.0,"I honestly adore this bakery in Santa Barbara! I don't get many chances to wake up on a Sunday to gorgeous weather and be able to casually enjoy a small morning snack but for the first time in a long time, I was finally able to do this! No better time spent than at Helena Avenue Bakery. The only way I can describe the vibe here is modern rustic with a cute outdoor seating area that's shaded with umbrellas. A small part of me was making comparisons between this place and Republique in LA which is a huge compliment given all the great things about Republique! The scale of their menu and baked goods are much smaller though but the vibe here still somehow reminds me of Republique. I chose three items to share between 2 people. 
-Matcha Latte - fairly standard, price about what I expect for the size, would recommend getting a hot one
-Blueberry and Lemon scone - I'm not typically a scone persony but I really wanted to try this one out. I wasn't disappointed! Lots of blueberry with a lemony glaze. The scone was flaky on the outside and soft on the inside.
-Peanut and cashew butter with Banana toast - Hands down one of the best nut butter mix spreads I've ever had spread thickly over perfectly toasted sourdough bread. I wonder if they make it in house or if it's bought from somewhere because....I need more of this! The thinly sliced banana pieces cover the entire toast topped with bits of rosemary which just adds that extra flavor kick. As easy as it sounds like it is to make this at home, enjoying the toast here was pretty darn delicious.

1005,3.0,"Soooo could have given 4 stars to this adorable place but the militant 11:00 am cut off of breakfast is just too, well, militant. Totally understand a kitchens need to change over but perhaps offer the simple granola with yogurt or create a breakfast ""flavored"" baguette to help out the late morning arrivals?? Maybe a fruit and yogurt parfait in the cold case??? Even on weekends if you spent the night out in the funk zone and return the next day in hopes of revitalizing only to be faced with a salad or sandwich at 11:02 am? Honestly it was 11:02. I would have rushed over had I known that s BAKERY would stop serving brekkie at 11:00. Who knew? Well I guess I do now. 
Suggestions to HSB.... help with the transition! I stood at the counter watching what I wanted to order be handed to the person who ordered 3 minutes earlier than me. OUCH! 
Even granola on yogurt would have earned you an extra star from this reviewer. A 3 minute exception to your hard an fast rule would have earned you 2 more stars despite the food only being a 4. Your staff is lovely. They must cringe when the clock strikes 11:00 knowing they can't bend to any pleading a customer might attempt. 
Don't fight the change .... give your customers a little help with the transition and next time we are here perhaps I can give you a star for improvement.

Pros: The bakery is in a shared space with a time tasting place. Its has warehouse, industrial and french vibes. It's beautiful and open!

1016,2.0,"So I live in Santa Barbara and have visited the bakery on multiple occasions, always walking away unimpressed and slightly irritated. This morning was no different. Sunday at 9 AM, no line yet, and I asked if the egg and cheddar biscuit could be made with sourdough instead, (I was looking at the shelves loaded with their sourdough loaves), but I got an unapologetic ""no, the kitchen doesn't do that"" response. Strike 1. Next, my friend ordered a bagel with cream cheese and tomato slices, and was sorely disappointed in the measly portion of 3 tiny slices of ""crisp"" and utterly flavorless Roma tomatoes that were given. For their prices, one should be getting organic tomatoes, or at least larger, juicier, higher-quality ripe tomatoes. Strike 2. My son and I waited a solid 15 minutes for our egg sandwiches to come out, and watched as others who came in after us received their orders well before us. When we did get the sandwiches, we had to do a careful investigation to find the egg. We had ordered scrambled, and upon close inspection under the ""hood"" we finally found it: the thinnest ""patty"" of egg I have ever encountered, barely to be tasted within all the brioche bun. My 7-year old asked, ""Where's the egg?"" and I should have brought it back up to the manager to show what was actually coming out of the kitchen for $8.  Strike 3. The croissant my daughter ordered was not flaky or fresh (Renaud's is infinitely better) and she left a lot of it on her plate (something she never does). It's too bad, because the location is good, atmosphere OK, and their bagels better than most in the area (lots of chew and tug, hearty).

I decided to have some of their fresh roasted coffee along with the Bacon, Cheddar & Egg Biscuit sandwich.

The sandwich is so tasty, with a wonderfully baked fluffy biscuit and a portion definitely big enough beyond a breakfast bite.

Sit inside you can check out the giant wine selections too, or enjoy a nice seat on the funky patio. Chillax, chill'n like a villain. Too cool for school. Nice spot to meet up with your peeps for a cool iced tea or nice hot coffee.

In your transporter? If you are early for breakfast you can park in the Lark / Lucky Penny lot and slip through the walk way. What parking in the Funk Zone? Yeah, easy cheesy.

Kick back relax, we enjoy the Helena Ave Bakery, SB Wine Collective and now you can order fresh local fish for pickup at the location near you from GET HOOKED at their pop-up giant card table. Killer fresh local fish!

The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating and the decor looks industrial/funky.  They have some nice breakfast options and we enjoyed our choices.  The only problem was that they took a very long time to deliver our meals and when my eggs arrived they were not hot.  I sent them back and kept an eye on the kitchen.  I had to go up to the cashier to ask if the eggs that were sitting on the counter in the kitchen were mine.  Yes they were and fortunately I saw them in time to enjoy them at the right temperature.

1081,3.0,"Bottom Line:  Very expensive but good food

Like a lot of places in the Funk Zone, this place is kitschy, filled with hipsters from LA and very expensive.

I have to say right off the bat that the food was good - we defiantly enjoyed it.    The thing is, it was so expensive that I'll never be back.  I love riding in new Mercedes but I would never own one as I simply cant justify the cost when I can have something else for 1/4 the price that is essentially the same and its gets me where im going in similar comfort.

We got the Burrata sandwich which was $15.....um, what?  $15 for bread, cheese, bacon - and it was delicious but $15?  Frankly, I resent the normalizing the $15 sandwich.  $10-$12 is already pushing it for some of our local hero sandwich shops and those are almost certainly good for two meals and I'm 6 foot 3.

We also got soup and a pastry.  Our bill with tip came out to more than $30

We also got there almost exactly when they opened and my wife had to fight to keep our seats as I had to go change our daughter diaper.  People - quite rudely actually - kept trying to physically take our seats as they we not occupied by humans but by our things as we were going to come back.  I get the feeling had we all gone to the bathroom at the same time, our things would have just been tossed onto the floor.

Lets not even discuss the parking situation.

Honestly, the LA hipsters can have this place.

Simple pastries, donuts etc. The place calls itself a bakery, so I assumed the croissants, pastries, and donuts would be very fresh. This was not the case. I had a ham & cheese croissant, which was ok, but not that fresh, flakey etc. My daughter ordered the ""seasonal donut"" which was $4.00. It was just an iced cake donut with colored sprinkles. Nothing more than you'd find at a cheap donut place for $1.00 or less. My wife had a blueberry danish. Again, it was OK, but not great. This place says it is a bakery.

1087,1.0,"This is a tough review to write, because I have been a devoted take-out customer of Helena Avenue Bakery since they opened. I live nearby, so I go in at least weekly and buy loaves of bread, biscuits and pastries. On Mother's Day, I even asked for their special breakfast of a biscuit with berries and cream, which my husband got to go. In fact, the day before this awful customer service experience, I had purchased over $45 in loaves of bread to take home. 

This past weekend was the first time I ever ordered drinks and sat down at a table to eat in. My husband and I took out-of-town friends for a special breakfast and it turned out to be a fiasco. The bakery was not crowded when we arrived on Friday morning. At the counter, the cashier (a 30-something brunette, who seemed to be the manager), was speaking over the customer in front of her, to a woman walking away, ""Would you like to register a complaint with the owner?"" The woman kept walking away and the cashier/manager turned to the customer in front of her and said: ""Nothing like a customer complaint when you're already having a shitty day."" She went on to complain about everything that went wrong with opening the shop that day before she took her order. My guest and I looked at each other and shrugged it off, since I had had so many positive experiences with take-out orders. 

We went outside and got a table and waited for the other two in our party to arrive. Later, the four of us went up to order. One of our party was a little picky - wanting to know what was in the green harissa, and that was met with some aggressive eye-rolling from the young man helping us. Finally, our order was placed. We sat on the patio and discovered there wasn't a pin to hold up the umbrella and it was starting to heat up. I went back up and waited in line to ask for a pin for the umbrella. The young man rolled his eyes again and said he'd look for it. Our iced teas were up on the bakery counter, so I took those and sat back down. I sent my husband up to get his coffee, which wasn't on the counter, and perhaps the pin for the umbrella, if the young man had located it. Ten minutes later my husband came back with his coffee and all our meals, which were wrapped in to go paper. One was a salad, so that was a mess. 

I went up and waited in line again to get plates, silverware and napkins for us all. There appeared to be plates in the self-serve area under the silverware, but went I bent down to get some, I noticed half the plates had bread crumbs and spilled milk on them. Half seemed clean and half seemed dirty, so I waited in line again to ask for plates. This time, the blonde barista waited on me and I asked for plates. She told me to get them in the area under the silverware, and seemed irritated when I told her half the plates there had milk and crumbs in them. She left and came back with 4 saucers. I asked her if there were no clean dinner plates and she rolled her eyes at me and said she'd see. 

Then, I stood there while she made 2 coffee orders, waiting. After she placed those orders on the counter, she looked at me and said, ""Oh yeah, plates."" She then went over to the kitchen area to a stack of plates. She picked up one and then another. She wiped crumbs off the 2nd and 4th plates with her hands and brought me a stack of 4 and aggressively asked, ""Are THESE big enough for you?"" I ignored the crumbs I had seen her brush off and said, ""Perfect. Thanks!"" 

Over the course of breakfast, which everyone thought tasted delicious, my male guest went back inside three different times and fetched iced tea refills for three of us in our party. When we left, we cleaned up after ourselves and put our dirty plates in the tubs provided. I stopped by the barista and asked her for some more iced tea and she sneered at me: ""Sorry. We don't provide free tea refills."" I said to my friend: ""I didn't realize you were paying for all those refills everytime you went back inside and got them. Thank you so much."" My friend said: ""I didn't. They were free."" He nodded to the same blonde female barista who had sneered No Free Refills at me and said: ""She gave them to me free."" 

So, if you are a handsome man, you'll get clean plates and free iced tea refills, but if you're a middle-aged, heavy-set female who drops about $50 a week in the establishment, be prepared to get dirty plates, a big sexist and ageist attitude and treated like shit. I've dropped my last dollar in this establishment and will be taking my business to the excellent D'Angelos Bakery, where their baked goods are cheaper and just as good, their breakfast menu has more than a couple of choices, their parking isn't a battle with day drinkers in the funk zone, and their staff doesn't treat customers with disdain, like weekend tourists they'll never see again.

The morning bun was not just-out-of-the-oven fresh and for $5 was basically a rip-off.  Morning buns need to be made in small batches and sold within a couple of hours of baking.  Ours was air-stale, hard, dry, and unappealing.

The $10 'green egg' (green harissa) biscuit overall was pretty good but the egg inside was not (allowed to spread too thin when being fried and thus much of it was cooked to a dry, paper thin crisp disc).  I suggest these folks take a field trip up to Pine State Biscuits in Portland, OR to see a better product being served at a better price.

Once I paid for my order I waited by the counter for 25 minutes while they prepared my plate.  During that time three different workers rearranged the accoutrements on the plate with their bare hands, picking up and replacing each piece of cheese like they were working on a Rubik's Cube.  While I appreciate having a nice presentation it seemed a little ridiculous to have three people not wearing gloves reorganize the dish while I stood there and watched.  Finally after the 25 minutes of charcuterie design I brought the cheese plate to my table.  It came with a ramekin full of seven almonds and no crackers.  Since we wanted something crunchy to go with our cheese I walked back up to the counter to ask for more almonds to which they told me I could NOT have extra.  I then asked the employee if I could purchase more almonds for ANY amount of money.  The employee responded ""NO"".

1134,4.0,"Cozy relaxed spot with good coffee. (5/5 green stars)
Plenty of indoor and outdoor shady seating and decent WiFi make this a good place to work. Nice music playing, from Beach House to Grizzly Bear. Great coffee - no pour-overs, but their drip coffee tasted fresh. It's from the Dart Coffee Co. (new to me) - lightly roasted Peruvian beans. Decent value too - I had a coffee, bagel with cream cheese and tomato, and muffin for about $9. Coffee refills are free, so I had a blueberry scone ($4) to go with the second cup ;) I have mixed feelings about their pastries. They all look good, and while the bagel tasted good, the muffin and scone were bland and both were a touch overdone. The muffin was listed as grapefruit poppy seed, and while the texture was good, there was no grapefruit flavor that I could detect. It was a Monday - perhaps an off-day?  Would recommend it for the coffee and ambiance, and I think the bakery side has potential - their baguette sandwiches look great.

I'm also giving Helena Avenue Bakery 5/5 ""green stars"" for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
* Their coffee, from Dart, is certified fair trade and organic. 
* They use organic flour for baking, sourced from Central Milling
* They have ceramic cups and plates and metal utensils for eating in-house.
* Items like sandwiches have just a simple paper wrap.
* Even items that come in packaging (like house-made pickles) they have made fairly sustainable choices (cardboard and PET). 
* Cold drinks cups are compostable, although hot cups and lids are not. 
* Water is available in little glass jars. 
* The support some local charities and events such as bike to work day and Heal the Oceans.

PS: The address is a bit confusing: if you approach from Anacapa Street, make your way past The Lark and you'll find this bakery next to the SB Wine Collective.

1137,5.0,"Helena Avenue Bakery is a must-visit for those looking for a great breakfast place in Santa Barbara. Not only is it in Downtown Santa Barbara, but it is located in the trendy FUNK ZONE close to the wharf. Really, you could start your day here and walk to a whole lot of points of interest from here.

The egg, ham and cheese in a biscuit breakfast sandwich is so hearty and filling that you could split it into two, if you like light breakfasts, and be good to walk around for several hours after.

The biscuit is so buttery and flaky. The pesto sauce was so good. The cheddar was sharp.

The heirloom tomato galette, though not as heavy in the tummy is still large and filling.

They also serve very good espresso coffees and teas.

Outdoor dining was available - when it was allowed. Masks are required.

Street parking is plentiful in the morning, not so much in the afternoon.

Helena Avenue Bakery shares their space with a wine tasting shop. So the space is a bakery in the morning and a wine tasting shop at night. Great concept!

Also, there is a doggie bowl of water provided for your four-legged friends/kids.

1139,4.0,"Every single thing I have had here I have loved! The churro donut, pesto asparagus salad, chocolate zucchini bread, peanut brittle cookie, chocolate chunk cookie, espresso, and so on. My all time favorite is probably the chocolate zucchini bread as it is so dense and flavorful while also tasting fresh and light on the digestive tract. The chocolate chunk cookie is a close second.

I haven't had many savory options here as they are pretty darn pricey for the portion size, however the couple I have had have been mighty tasty, fresh, and packed with the perfect combo of flavors. So in a sense, yes it's expensive but you are really getting what you pay for. They have many breakfast options that are served until 11 am then the lunch baguettes and side salads take over. 

Personally, I'd recommend this spot if you are looking for an artisanal breakfast with craft coffee and quality foods and/or sweets. It's also a nice spot for those wine tasting in the funk zone and want a little snack-a-roo between tasting rooms without walking too far and/or eating too much. 

Food is tasty, staff are kind, and the environment is adorable - The only downside to this spot for me is the prices. It would be a full 5 stars in my opinion if things were just a little more affordable. I'd also enjoy if they had a little more lunch options that didn't include so much bread in them or paying $10 for a few bites of delicious greens instead. Wraps would be awesome!

1156,3.0,"Stopped in here for a small pastry breakfast and a drink on a Friday morning. It's a gorgeous place with a really cute patio. 

I ordered a little strawberry custard pastry and took a chance on their tea-making skills. My husband opted for a drip coffee.

It's a really lovely setting, and you can see into the kitchen inside. Friendly service. Most everything you need (water, stir sticks, sugars, etc) are all accessible and they give you a number to take to your table.

We sat outside with our pastries and my tea came out within a few minutes. It's a loose leaf blend. As far as I could tell it was good quality tea... but they served a miniscule amount in a huge bowl of a cup. Like, less than a teaspoon full. So even after leaving it to infuse for a long time there was barely any color or flavor to it. I couldn't be bothered to chase it up so I just drank it. The rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon per cup, plus one for the pot. Obviously this wasn't in a pot but a heaping teaspoon is still required for a regular cup, so a big mug like this could use 2.

The pastry was heavier than it looked, more like a cinnamon roll with custard and strawberry than a butter pastry. It was nice, a good size, fresh fruit, not too sweet. 

Really lovely setting and overall a decent experience, but it did fall below my expectations a little bit. I know tea is tricky but if you're making the effort to serve a nice loose leaf, it's worth serving it correctly.",IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,Helena Avenue Bakery,Santa Barbara,4.0,-119.6906718,34.4144445,"Food, Restaurants, Salad, Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch, Sandwiches, Bakeries","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '8:0-14:0', 'Wednesday': '8:0-14:0', 'Thursday': '8:0-14:0', 'Friday': '8:0-14:0', 'Saturday': '8:0-14:0', 'Sunday': '8:0-14:0'}","131 Anacapa St, Ste C",CA

1207,5.0,"Back and with a new menu...some old favorites still available and new ones like their SB Bowl.  If you are vegan, skip the egg (sub Avo) & skip the feta.  Would recommend they offer some non dairy cheese option here..non dairy feta is wonderful.  
As usual, fantastic lattes with oat milk! 
Great service...many familiar faces.  Thank you Sierra!
They do offer some gluten free sweets like a gluten free brownie (but do not think it is vegan...).  Really encouraging places to offer some gluten free vegan options when they can. 
The breads are amazing.  If you are not strict gluten free, their sourdough is a good option given how sourdough is made. And it is one of the few times, I will skip my usual gluten free needs and dive into their breads.  The sandwiches made on their breads take the idea of a ""sandwich"" and bring it to the next level.  So good.  
Still a local favorite spot mixed with some interesting visitors that have now discovered this treat!

oh by the way if there is a line, it moves fast (usually).

Tip: Order Online for Take Out in advance.  Then stroll to the beach for a nice walk.  Take the route along State street to enjoy some nice window shopping OR go the side street past Lucky Penny & Shopkeepers (great store), then to the beach..just a few blocks away.

I live within walking distance so I turned right back around to go home and placed an online order for pickup ~45 min later. 

We got the elvis style banana bread, wildflower honey ricotta on sourdough toast, and the green eggs and ham on a biscuit. I was most pleasantly surprised by the elvis because it's not something I would have normally ordered but the flavors complemented each other so well and the banana bread itself was great. It was a huge chunk of bread so it was also a more filling dish than I expected. We both loved the ricotta toast, which was light and more dessert like. The sourdough bread was very impressive - very soft on the inside with lots of crunch on the outside. Lastly, the green eggs and ham was great with the green harissa sauce and there was a huge piece of fluffy egg. It's not a sauce I've had before on a breakfast sandwich and I was a fan!

1227,2.0,"Admittedly, it's a cool vibe interior and the location is conveniently close to my office, but no more visits here because this restaurant has lost any attachment to reality getting so expensive that it pissed me off.  I've always appreciated that this bakery has nice treats in a space where you can watch production. However it was charging $1.50 for a coffee refill which was already the most expensive coffee refill in town.  

Now, you'll pay $2 FOR A COFFEE REFILL.  Nope...no mas! I'm done with these clowns regardless of how cute or convenient it is. Businesses can certainly raise prices per some supply and demand curve or supposed ROI or other factors as if they are just spreadsheet driven choices, but there comes a point when actual human beings will be so outraged they'll write the business off completely no matter the justification, and they'll tell everyone they know. Helena Avenue Baker crossed that line today. 

BTW it's not just the coffee refills. You'll find poorly conceived sandwiches don't even start until $11 for a baguette with a couple of pieces of meat and cheese thrown in between. To this business and the Lark's other properties which have gotten wildly rich on the revitalization of the funk zone, ""How much money is enough for you?

I ordered the squash salad as my main dish and my friend got the avo toast sans egg. She really enjoyed hers but it is difficult to mess up avo toast. I have heard from several people that that is their go-to at this place so I may try it one day.

My salad was so so salty. I can't even remember what the rest of it tasted like because I was overwhelmed by the salt. Not sure if they seasoned it too heavily or if the dressing was too heavily salted but I was disappointed as I couldn't taste the squash or squash blossom flavor, or anything else in the dressing. 

I wish that I'd ordered something else. Overall, I would come back for a pastry maybe but probably not a sit-down meal. They don't have a ton of options and they're all pretty expensive.

1256,4.0,"So the address is 131 Anacapa, but technically the bakery is closer to another street... Helena Avenue, whaddayaknow? If you see a restaurant called The Lark, keep walking past the patio seating until you see the Santa Barbara Wine Collective. Entrance is the same (same owner actually), and you will see some signs and bread on display. 

On the menu you will find baked goods, pies, drinks, artisan bread, and a limited amount of food items. Breakfast is served all day, they make a great brioche breakfast sandwich and smoked salmon bagel. Lunch starts at 11AM, you can choose from a couple sourdough sandwiches, a cheeseboard, or 
Tuscan Kale Caesar Salad. Their menu is not as extensive compared to other places, but quality over quantity. 

Before you roll your eyes, their rendition of avocado toast was pretty unique and had a couple ingredients not normally added. The sourdough was toasted a bit too long, it was hard to knife through the charred edges. On top you have a delicious spread of Carpinteria organic avocados that held everything together. Slices of cucumber (could do without), a couple of sprouts (gross), and some feta (yummy) are included. For flavor, they add a sprinkle of pepper and sunflower seeds. I also got an egg for $2. Maybe too much fluff that didn't need to be there, but a good dish nonetheless. Went well with the iced vanilla latte I ordered.

The female cashier at counter was okay not super courteous, however the server was courteous and trying. Overall,  we felt like they need to maybe hire more folks to speed up service. He was serving all the tables alone. My coffee was not even lukewarm, it was cool. It had a bland flavor. It was in a paper cup. The biscuit with jam was also disappointing. Generously portioned, it was quite dense and moist but the blueberry and strawberry jam was very bitter, so much so that I needed to get up from my table (because server was so busy) and ask for honey at the counter to sweeten it up a bit.  The cashier gave me a tiny bit of honey, sparingly. Then, you are asked to bus your own table. That's also fine; but don't ask for a 15% or more tip when paying at the counter via the machine.

1260,3.0,"Funny story. Rules versus common sense.
Very understaffed, probably because of Covid so I get it. Everything looked so delicious I couldn't decide. To help me decide I asked if the ham and cheese sandwich came with the cheese melted. The 17 year old surfer at the register said ""yes"". So I chose it over the pastrami. When I receive it, cheese is definitely not melted. I ask the food runner to run it back to melt the cheese real quick, I don't want to pay $15 for ham and a slice of Swiss. I want a restaurant caliber sandwich. He comes back and tells me , ""we can't melt the cheese"". My husband has, in front of him, a pastrami sandwich with MELTED CHEESE. I take the sandwich up front myself and I ask the manager to just stick the silly sandwich under the broiler for me. No biggie. She says she can't. So I tell her I was specifically informed that it would be melted and now I don't want it. Very nicely. She gives me a blank stare. So I ask her to give me a pastrami sandwich instead. Which she does. My mother in law also ordered the ham sandwich, neither of us got the cornichons that are advertised. 
The thing is, as a cook, I know how easy it is to broil a sandwich. 
So. Excellent bread, terrible ham sandwich without anything to make it worth the $$. Beautiful menu. Don't order the ham sandwich. Nice staff who don't care at all, (no water in the jug though we asked twice), and the staff need to be trained on the menu they're selling. Everything is tasty but for that price they should know how to BROIL SOME CHEESE. So now the manager will go home and complain to her partner about the crazy lady who sent back a sandwich because the cheese wasn't melted. Ok. For $15 I get to, (as long as I'm nice) insist on what was advertised.

The cinnamon roll was so good! It was soft and well balanced in its sweetness. We wished it would've been warmer, when we got it it wasn't as hot as we would've liked.

The breakfast sandwich on brioche is pretty big! I really like the flavors, my one complaint is the egg patty is pretty thick and sometimes that's all I would taste.

1265,4.0,"Stumbled on Helena Avenue Bakery after searching for a quick lunch to take on the road.

Southern Fried Chicken on brioche (sandwich): this fried chicken sandwich was one of the most unique ones I have ever eaten, if only it was executed properly.. 
The good: brioche (golden and good crumb, grilled so it was toasty); jalapeño jam (sweet with a nice kick); black pepper bacon (peppery as advertised and extremely crispy)
The ""bad"": the chicken was incredibly crunchy and chicken well seasoned, but unfortunately a bit dry and burnt on some ends. 

I'd still recommend the chicken sandwich but I'd hope this was just an off day and that they don't aways serve burnt fried chicken because all of the other components of the sandwich were fantastic. Another gripe I have is that I ordered 3 spicy versions of the sandwich and none of them were spicy. Didn't go back because we were already on the freeway.

1279,5.0,"Egg & Cheese Biscuit Sandwich! Get it! The biscuit might be the best biscuit I've tasted. Fluffy, doughy inside, crisp, glaze outside. There has to be some browned butter or grass fed butter involved. So good! The egg is served slightly runny and it's creamy yolk is the perfect compliment to the tomato jam. Heavenly! 

If you want a grown up take on the classic McDonald's Sausage Biscuit. Walk over to Rebar Coffee and Kitchen across the street, order a side of their house made (amazing) sausage patty, then head over to Helena Avenue Bakery and order the Egg & Cheese Biscuit Sandwich. Once you get your sandwich, pry it open, careful not to mess up it's yummy contents and place your Rebar sausage patty inside. Re-wrap and voila!...You have an incredible gourmet, adult take on a childhood favorite! 

I also highly recommend any of their quiches. The crust is legendary! 

Great customer service. Order at the counter and wait for them to call your name or number. Self-serve water, napkins and utensils. Plenty of seating amongst the long farm-style tables and chairs.

I'm really happy to witness the evolution of Helena Avenue Bakery. It started out small, with a very limited menu. Now it is bustling!

Then, the bakery is in the back part of a group of food establishments. There is a numbered type of map in front of the walled area  of the group. Once I found the place , saw the menu , I still wanted the sandwich I ordered , as I wanted good bacon & I got it! First , ALL the sandwiches sounded tasty .

1284,3.0,"Ok disclaimer that this review may be unpopular but it is my opinion only. We were staying in the area and had heard about this bakery which was known for some great breakfast sandwich items so we stopped by. We ordered the breakfast sandwich and the crispy chicken sandwich.

Breakfast sandwich: 3/5
Reading the reviews I was excited to try it. As the reviews mention the egg is perfectly soft. What I found lacking was any flavor. The brioche bread was not as buttery or sweet as others I have had and I was just expecting more.

Chicken sandwich: 4/5
After taking my first bite I was underwhelmed but realized what the problem was. The bacon is too chewy and distracts from the perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside chicken. So I removed the bacon and took my second bite and loved the sandwich. I would order the chicken sandwich with the bacon on the side.

You order at the counter (usually after waiting in a line out the door), and their servers bring the food out to your table. Even though the sandwiches look small, they're pretty filling, and the baked egg block is fluffy. The green eggs and ham on brioche is my go-to; it doesn't taste like any old breakfast sandwich because of that delicious green harissa! I didn't like the farmer's market sandwich on brioche because it was really soggy, perhaps from the Swiss chard. 

For a sweeter option, the Elvis is my favorite hefty, rich treat. Who knew that banana bread, peanut butter, bacon, and honey would go so well together?

1309,5.0,"I love love love the casual atmosphere, friendly service, and solid sweet and savory food selection at this adorable bakery...

I recently spent a long weekend in Santa Barbara with my family and close friends that are renting a house in the area for the month.  Helena Avenue Bakery was the first place we went upon arrival and the last place we visited before our drive back, and I think we stopped by once or twice in between as well.

Some of my favorite menu items from all of those visits:
-Avocado Toast
-Turkey Sandwich
-Kale Caesar Salad
-Homemade Potato Chips
-Hummus and BabaGhanoush

We also purchased some fresh sourdough and country seed bread loaves to-go.  (They will slice it if you ask as long as it's not so early that it's too warm out of the oven to do so).  My kids had their donuts but didn't love them... I think they looked better than they tasted.  I also had a fabulous Americano with almond milk.

Shout-out to Lauren who didn't lose her cool as my husband and I visited first thing on a Sunday before our drive back home and kept adding on to our order.  First it was just coffee and bread, then we decided we needed a sandwich and salad for the road, then we ordered donuts, chips, hummus, etc... Thanks Lauren!

Hope to visit again on future visits to Santa Barbara, and hopefully do a wine tasting with you as well!",IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,Helena Avenue Bakery,Santa Barbara,4.0,-119.6906718,34.4144445,"Food, Restaurants, Salad, Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch, Sandwiches, Bakeries","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '8:0-14:0', 'Wednesday': '8:0-14:0', 'Thursday': '8:0-14:0', 'Friday': '8:0-14:0', 'Saturday': '8:0-14:0', 'Sunday': '8:0-14:0'}","131 Anacapa St, Ste C",CA

The nice surprise was actually the sourdough bread with olive. It was about $10 (or $12 I can't remember). It's actually sour but not to the point that you get a bitter aftertaste. It's so clearly hand-made since the air bubbles inside are uneven. The bread has a nice crisp on the outside and it's very soft on the inside. Also quite chewy!

It was just past 7am when I walked in. There was one couple seated, but the kitchen was teeming with staff baking away! What a cool sight! The restaurant appears to be shared with a winery; the venue was spacious and well-decorated! Though there only appeared to be a few dedicated parking spaces, I had no trouble finding a spot close by. 

The staff were friendly and the menu was vast. I ordered a mocha and the ricotta toast and they were both out of this world. The mocha was one of the best I've ever had, and the toast had the perfect blend of sweet and savory  atop a hearty slab of bread! They went together so well. What a treat!

Today was my first time here but certainly not my last. I've attempted to come in the past only to be greeted by a line out the door. As I was leaving, a group of 10 walked in.

I was shockingly disappointed.  I'm obsessed with escargot, naturally I ordered the escargot flat bread and I sweat they soaked them in some form of very tart citrus juice.. it was so bad 20 minutes after we left I still could NOT get the overpowering taste out of my mouth, it was so bad I got 3 ulcers from the acidity... and duck fat fries, they legit tasted NO different than hot fries from McDonald's, SAD

Very perfect setting for an Instagram-worthy photo session, girls night out, romantic date night, or simple catching up with family and friends. What is very unique here is their complimentary self-serve popcorn with different spices/ flavors to add on top! 

Their main courses are also off-the-charts! I highly recommend their brussel sprouts as an appetizer! They are so crispy and the aoili dip compliments the flavor very well. I also recommend their gnocchi for any carb lovers out there! The mushroom pasta was particularly my favorite, however, my friends stated it was slightly salty. 

Their milky way dessert display was beautiful but was it worth the cash? Not really. It was okay. Very tiny cookie bites spread around a big dish mixed with assorted chocolates. I'll definitely skip that dessert and try the other ones next time. 

Their wines and cocktails are pretty cheap! And they also have half-off select wine bottles during happy hour from 3:30 to 5:30 PM. I loved the Eberle Cabernet Sauvignon. Very smooth and not too bitter. 

The only minor complaint about the location is the absence of lighting outdoors at night. Hopefully there will be a string of lights and also working heaters for the winter time in the future.

We asked a few questions about menu and our waiter answered and seemed knowledgeable about menu. We ordered crab devil eggs and fries for app. Both were very tasty.

Another had veggie sandwich and said it was okay, more cheesy than veggie. Had to ask twice for another wine. Also did  not get itemized check, just total on table side machine.

1366,2.0,"Recently visited New Orleans for a extended weekend. Three out of five of us were excited about the bottomless Veuve Clicquot Rose they offer for brunch. Regretfully, after they pour you the first drink you have to chase your server down for a refill. Be prepared, just trying to set expectations appropriately. I also wanted to mention the over all service at this restaurant is below standard. That's the issue, no service. Our waiter Nikolas would spend more time standing around talking and playing on his computer that he takes orders with, than helping the table help (assistant). We had to ask for things 2 and 3 times. It was quite annoying. I wanted to forewarn you the food is EXTREMELY salty. Be prepared for some flavor. Two of the five of us in the party left with stomach aches due to over salting/seasoning. Lastly, double check your bill. Our server once we were done with brunch came over and gave us our total and didn't supply us with a copy of the bill. When he told us the amount, we all looked at one another and thought it was high. Sure enough after asking for a copy of our bill were charged for one more bottomless Veuve Clicquot Rose. It felt very unethical honestly. Though portrayed as an error, something didn't seem nor feel right. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to friends, family or colleagues. There are many choices in New Orleans, good choices... My reasoning for giving the two stars is because Nikolas's help really worked hard and did all he could.

I've been consistently impressed with the food and drink, though the service leaves something to be desired (mostly just the speed and occasionally the accuracy). I love to order a glass of wine at happy hour and sit out on their patio, which is the stuff of my dreams: literally, just plants as far as the eye can see. My favorite lunchtime order is the fried shrimp poboy (their pepper jelly and pickled okra are SO GOOD) with a side of gumbo. They have a huge selection of wines and I've only tried a few of them; one was excellent, and the other (the house red) wasn't great, but I didn't have super high expectations for the budget blend.

1371,2.0,"I enjoy trying new places when I come to visit New Orleans. I had high hopes for this restaurant based on reviews and photos on Instagram. As I walked in, my party was not formally greeted and there was no direction for seating. I found a worker that led me to the hostess stand, but there was no hostess available. As I waited, its clear the establishment did not have a functional system to handle walk-ins and reservations. Also, it's very unprofessional to leave the hostess stand unattended for long periods. It's understandable to be swamped on a Friday night, but there needs to be more efficient communication within the waiting area. Overall, we stood confused for about 15 minutes waiting for a directive. Finally, the hostess arrived, and we asked for a table for two. At 7:30 PM, she said they were completely booked until 9:45 PM. I told her to put my name on the list for 9:45 PM, and headed to my vehicle. However, I looked on Open Table, and they had a reservation for 7:45 PM. This was purposefully not communicated to us by the hostess, and we were essentially lied to. We made the reservation for 7:45 PM and went back to the lounge. Although we had a confirmed earlier reservation, they still hesitated to seat us because they were ""confused."" While they were ""confused"" they still sat other people who had reservations at the same time or after us. I felt as if we were treated unfairly with major hunts of racial stereotyping and bias . We finally decided to sit at the bar instead. The bartenders were nice and extremely helpful. However, the hostesses need work.

1372,1.0,"Terrible service and the food was underwhelming and that's being nice. My wife and I decided to give copper vine a try. I will say the decor was very nice and inviting. We had several glasses of wine. A decent selection to choose from and several choices of size of pour that allows you a chance to try several different ones if you want to  experiment. 
The issue was the inconsistent service, absent-minded and slow. A little bit after we arrive and party of 20+ arrived. It looked like a group from a local CBD office. That group sucked up all the service. I comment to my wife we should probably order something before the large table because it may overwhelm the kitchen. After a few moments we order some duck fat Fries and a duck confit Flatbread. We were initially told that the duck Confit wasn't available then told it just wasn't ready yet.  So we went with the fries. Low and behold several flatbreads including a duck confit flatbread we delivered to the large table less than 5 minutes later. Our fries to 20min and we well fries. Not special.  Then we ordered a different flatbread. 25 min later I flagged down the server to ask where it was. Apparently a mistake was made so he said he would rush out another order.  20 min later a server comes out with a flatbread and wanders ultimately placing the flatbread on the large table of 20+ and I can hear them asking among themselves who ordered it?.......well no one because it was ours. So I flagged again and told it would be rushed again and yes, 20 min it finally arrived. And well it was underwhelming at best. A flatbread is a simple square/rectangular pizza on a thin crackery/crispy crust. How do you mess that up?  Was bland. We just finished up and left. We were there to enjoy some wine on a Friday evening so we stayed for that reason. Then it just became comical.

1373,2.0,"I was excited about this place as I had passed it  it a few times when I was waking by although the atmosphere is nice it defiantly has some flaws. First of all is the acoustics...GET READY TO SCREAAAMMMM. Next the service although somewhat efficient they actually only  had one server for the entire restaurant (although did have food Runners and bartender) but he obviously forgot to put my main course in which was a big issue when telling him at the start I was heading to the pelicans game and on a schedule. Apparently that did not  mean much although he did bring me my bill before my forgotten food even came out! And I was somehow charged a 20% tip as a default for my forgotten order before I even got my main course when I was planning  to leave cash tip. Thankfully I noticed it before I tipped double on severely neglected service and subpar food. 

The food was not good. The beet salad although sorta pretty came out filled with morose chunks of beets that could have choked a cow. But HEY the underlaying sauces made it look pretty...although didn't really help the taste. They should really add some greens as a base and ummm carve the beets into something a human could choke down. 

Then the main course which was a flatbread margarita pizza took 40 min after the salad. Obviously forgotten the pizza came out cold and slopped together on the fly. Obviously waiter error and he would not acknowledge it. 

WINE BAR: To top it off their wine selection by the bottle is severely overpriced  and the tap wines by the glass ...up to bottle are basic and uninteresting. This is the sort of place that could easily boast a high end list but instead they gobble up your dollars assuming you are a tourist or on a business tab $$.

He was so friendly, welcoming, informative, willing and able to answer our questions, and was checking in on us appropriately and unobtrusively. As a local, I like to drag my sister to ""Brunch Recon"" before I bring out-of-town guests. The space has been beautifully renovated since it's days as Happy's, lots of natural light, comfy bench seating with pillows, lovely courtyard seating option weather permitting. Brunch menu has something for everyone, Bottomless mimosas were on point - they give you the orange juice in a small, separate carafe so you are able to add as little or as much as you'd like. We ordered the fig and goat cheese flatbread, the shrimp and grits, and the gulf fish. Shrimp and grits were excellent - grits were flavorful and not runny like they can be some places. Gulf fish was cooked perfectly and the green beans were in a subtle, tasty sauce. Fig and goat cheese flatbread had - dare I say- TOO  MUCH goat cheese, but was still very tasty. Would order everything again, but will probably try something new next time as there were so many delicious sounding choices. My bottomless glass was never empty, and believe me, I tried!! We never felt rushed, and actually had to ask for the check which was so wonderful in a ""bottomless"" environment. Highly recommend Copper Vine for bottomless brunch!

I understand that they want to get other people seated and make more money but it is my right as a customer to take my time and enjoy my dinning experience. ( Especially since I made reservations) Maybe I just caught them on a bad day but management definitely needs to speak to the waiters and hostess about being kind , pleasant and patient with the customers- after all , we are how you stay in business .

1412,1.0,"Presentation of the Place: The Bathrooms are nice. It reminds you of  an overpriced hotel that you can feel fancy in while taking a dump. The inside of the place reminds me of an amalgamation of the sets of Cheers, Sex in the City, and some French Noir.

The Food: 

Starter:

Jumbo Lump Crab Deviled Eggs

So, this is the first of many dishes were the common complaint is the lack of salt in the food. From the egg, filling, and crab itself, everything was void of salt or seasoning except for what was a little paprika. The textures are boring and 1 dimensional. For 8 dollars, you are getting 3 deviled eggs at the lowest effort of innovation and care. It is something with less flavor and passion than the ones you are partaking in during Thanksgiving at your grandmas.

Brussels Sprouts with Garlic Aioli and Grated Parmesan.

The Brussels sprouts are cooked exceptional well, which is rare. This is ruined, by the lack of salt and seasoning again. I assume this is due to the amount of Parmesan shaved on top of the dish. This gives the dish an overwhelming umami flavor, and it forces you to reach for the garlic aioli to counter it. After about 10 bites, you begin to realize how white you are because you are essentially eating cheese and mayo. 


Entrees:

Ratatouille with filet

No salt on the filet on top. No salt in the dish itself. What is on the Filet is a lot of balsamic vinegar, which is overpowering. The tomato paste hasn't been stewed long enough, so the dish is really acidic especially with the amount of balsamic vinegar being used.  

Quail and Boudin

This dish is weird. If you ever had a fever dream and was wondering man I wish I could eat that, this is what it taste like. The portion of boudin and quail you get is actual small for the price. Guess what the quail doesn't have on it? The fry on the quail isn't good and the breading breaks offs. The chicken gumbo taste so strange like they almost put soy sauce in it and also has notes of sour. The boudin is really good and is the oasis in this odd dish. 


Drinks:

1 Bottle of the Smith and Hook. Your standard Cabernet nothing flashy.
 
Service: 

I usually don't critique service. I understand that we all take breaks at work, but man no water refills, the restaurant isn't busy, and people from the pass are having to bring our food. This is happening while you and your bartender friend are talking the entire time. Not a good look hombre.  

Verdict: A Salty No

Finally this chipper but rather confused host comes out to semi great us, but was paying a lot of attention to what was going on back where he had just arrived from. When I asked if we could sit upstairs, we were informed there was a party, which was fine, and then requested the main floor patio.

They offered plenty of  accoutrements with the selection. High quality meat and cheese noted and were not skimpy on portions. Probably could skip the flat bread next time.

1420,4.0,"Finally got to try Copper Vine for brunch.  Basically, the two big pluses are the food and the ambience.  The courtyard is VERY nice now that we're starting to get some cooler days.  The food was also mostly very good.  The deviled eggs appetizer, while good, wasn't really a standout over other deviled eggs I've had at restaurants.  The main dishes, however, were much better.  My salmon dish was pretty good.  The salmon was nicely cooked and seasoned.  The spinach was very well seasoned as well.  In fact, for some it might be TOO well seasoned.  For me it was enjoyable because I like a bit of spice, but you guys may want to mention on the menu that the spinach features a pretty heavy sprinkle of red pepper flake.  In fact, I'd probably refer to it as a ""spicy"" spinach because I could definitely see some people being taken by surprise.  The crabcake dish was also very good.  Crabcake was very heavy in crabmeat and light on filler.  Potatoes were done nicely, and sauces on both dishes were handled just right.  As far as main dishes go, the main negatives were the Dutch Baby being I think a bit underdone and the poached eggs having slightly overdone yolks but slightly underdone whites.  No idea how they pulled that one off...    But the main reason for subtraction of a star is the service.  First off, lil black dude who was the host, seemed to have ZERO care about doing his job.  We walked in to no smile or greeting or anything.  He just looked at us.  Fiancee says Hi table for two please.  He says ""this way"" and unceremoniously brings us to a table right next to the other two parties in the entire place.  So the courtyard has (I counted) 11 tables.  There are 3 parties in total dining at the time.  And he thinks it a good idea to sit us all on top of one another.  That's just a lack of care or common sense or both.  Spread us out a bit!!  He did seem to care GREATLY, however, when an attractive single diner came in.  Even came back to check on her at some point to see that she was ""doing OK"" *eyeroll*.  Our waitress, on the other hand, was very nice, but maybe seemed to not have a great grip on the POS system as literally EVERY DISH was brought to the wrong table.  Not just ours, but everyone else's.  By the time we had all of our food, there were only 4 tables occupied.  How hard can it be?  Also, she completely forgot my second drink.  BUT she caught her mistake and brought it on the house.  So that is a great positive.  She realized she made a mistake and went above and beyond to make it right without me even bringing it up.  But at the end of the day, the food was very good so I'll very probably be back.  Just, in all honesty, replace the host.  I'm never one to try to rid people of their employment, but if he's only going to show hospitality to patrons he thinks he can flirt with, then he is quite simply in the wrong business.  That, and retrain your wait staff on the table numbers.

While we were waiting for our drinks, a party of three walked in and seated themselves at a large table behind us. The hostess came over and explained that the table was already reserved and they could be seated inside. One of the men was awful - so condescending and entitled - barking that he knew the manager and to just tell her he'd be sitting down. The poor hostess went to get her manager, Lydia, who came out and greeted the customers warmly. Lydia didn't waste a moment before throwing her hostess under the bus -- she apologized to the rude patrons on her hostess' behalf, and said she had moved around other reservations so they could have the table. Now, a party who had actually made a reservation and requested an outdoor table, would be bumped inside because the manager refused to stand up to this patron -- not a great way to run a business. Now for the food -- Copper Vine has their menu coded with ""gluten free."" Nowhere does it say that the items are only GF when specified or modified -- it just labels them GF. I ordered the pork belly, which purports to just be gluten free, but mentioned that I have celiac, and our waitress responded ""oh, let me actually go ask the kitchen. I don't think the menu key is right."" She went and checked, and much to my shock, was right. At this point, I was rattled and wanted to talk to someone who truly knew what was gluten free. Our waitress sent over the manager, Lydia again, who had literally no information. She started off with ""well I try to eat gluten free too,"" which is never something that someone with celiac wants to hear. I could tell she was making it up as she went, as she couldn't answer any follow up questions. If I'd been with my boyfriend, we would have just left.

1426,4.0,"Came here with a friend who made a same-day dinner reservation for a Saturday night. It was a rainy weekend so unfortunately the patio was closed for seating, but I can imagine dining in their outside space would be so nice! 

We split a bottle of Malbec wine (750ML, $36) and 3 appetizers: black truffle fries ($9), brussels sprouts ($8) and the bianca flatbread with added charcuterie on top ($14). We were a bit worried the portions would be too small to share but it filled us up perfectly! Everything was tasty. The parmesan aioli that came with the fries was particularly good, and I actually preferred it over the aioli that came with the brussels sprouts. We added charcuterie to our bianca flatbread for an extra $3 and while the amount of meat was on the measly side, it was very tasty and paired well with the three cheese flatbread -- in layman's terms, it tasted like mildly sweet little cubes of ham LOL. The water also tasted like it's cucumber-infused. 

In light of the new COVID mask guidelines, some staff members were and some were not masked. Service was extremely attentive. We were asked a few times how everything was and were also offered a dessert menu towards the end of our meal. They were able to split our bill between two different cards. We stayed a while (probably longer than welcome) to just chat and finish our wine, and I didn't feel too pressured by staff to hurry up and pay and leave. As for the ambience, while definitely nice, people eating there ranged from couples dressed up for date night to just casual groups of friends i.e. dress up if you want to but also don't feel pressured to! 

I've been told from friends who have gone to Copper Vine prior that there used to be a popcorn dispenser free to customers, so not too sure what's up with that anymore. Overall, seems like a popular spot for a fancier night out!

1428,4.0,"Wow. This space has certainly come a long way since it was Happy's and I really have to commend the owners on the change. It honestly looks nothing like it used to and there's even a fancy upstairs area now!

David and I were here for his cousin's birthday celebration and we were seated upstairs. We didn't have a full dinner, but we did have some really good fries and we had a few cocktails. First, since it's a wine bar, I started with a really good malbec that was reasonably priced. I like that they give you the option of a half pour or whole pour, I guess in case you want to just do some tastings. Even though they mainly specialize in wine, they do have a full bar and a pretty decent beer selection. I had the Holy Roller IPA which was a fairly priced $7, especially considering the atmosphere of the place. 

We hung out at a while and they didn't rush us at all as we basically just sipped drinks and enjoyed conversation. Every now and then I did feel that they forgot about us (I ordered coffee that never came), but all in all it was a good experience and it good place to start your evening.",YNjyv0gfOr2g8lbmUpTnKg,Copper Vine,New Orleans,4.5,-90.0744274301,29.9506467229,"Nightlife, Pubs, Event Planning & Services, Wine Bars, Bars, Gastropubs, Restaurants, Venues & Event Spaces","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '10:30-22:0', 'Sunday': '10:30-21:0'}",1001 Poydras St,LA

Copper Vine has multiple wine menus...I wanted to try something new but didn't know where to start. Grace made a few knowledgable suggestions and even brought over the sommelier. Since we were having a casual night I was unsure about bringing over the sommelier...typically I would shy away from something like that. WOW, I was so pleasantly surprised! She was so bubbly and friendly. She didn't sacrifice any professionalism in her demeanor but talked about wine in a way that wasn't elitist...I felt like she didn't care if we thought she knew a lot, she wanted us to know about wine and the brand. This girl is something special. By the end of our talking I had a flight of 3 amazing wines...a Napa Valley sauvignon blanc, a chardonnay from Santa Barbra, and an Albarino....and I could tell you about all 3, Thanks Copper Vine!  The night we visited was busy and we definitely weren't the table spending the most money....the sommelier still came back to check in and continue conversation. Grace was attentive and ensured we enjoyed our experience. We felt welcome and every staff member seemed to be happy and passionate.

The space is beautiful; walking distance to the dome jf you want to go before the game or easily accessible to an after work happy hour for people who work downtown. 

The menu is creative but maybe a little too ambitious and the kitchen seems to be a little sloppy. The best appetizer I've had is the lump crab deviled eggs which are served as 3 halves. Three. Not 4, not 2. This makes splitting awkward and every time I go I chuckle about not getting the remaining half. I've had the ratatouille which is hearty but despite all the different ingredients tastes like it's just oregano. This dish also led to unfortunate digestive issues later. The second time I visited it was for brunch and my crab cake Benedict, along with another persons dish, arrived with hard boiled eggs which were supposed to be poached. I stuck my fork in the egg expecting the yolk to come dripping out but instead the ball just rolled elsewhere on the plate. I felt bad, but I had to ask for another egg. Even though we were one of maybe 4 parties in the entire restaurant, by the time I got our servers attention the crab cakes were cold. The egg they brought me later was undercooked enough that I questioned if it would make me sick (the white still has clear parts in it) so I opted not to eat it. 

I feel like I've given them a fair shot at this point and they've disappointed me each time so I don't plan on returning again.",YNjyv0gfOr2g8lbmUpTnKg,Copper Vine,New Orleans,4.5,-90.0744274301,29.9506467229,"Nightlife, Pubs, Event Planning & Services, Wine Bars, Bars, Gastropubs, Restaurants, Venues & Event Spaces","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '10:30-22:0', 'Sunday': '10:30-21:0'}",1001 Poydras St,LA

You enter the restaurant through the courtyard, which is a decent size for the CBD. The existence of a courtyard is especially noteworthy in pandemic times - some people want to avoid dining indoors - and the fact that it's shaded is major bonus points.

I placed my to-go order with the host and then sat in a corner to wait. There was a table with wipes and sanitizer by the door, and all the employees seemed to be properly wearing masks. There wasn't anyone dining in, but I got there right as they opened, so it was still early.

I was brought my drink immediately, per my request, though they also offered water while I waited. My food was ready about 15 minutes later. I got the Pick 2 combo of crawfish grilled cheese and sunflower arugula salad, and along with the standard utensils and napkins, they included 2 packets of alcohol wipes.

Anyways, drinks: beer selection is weak, but I went into this understanding this is a winepub so no need to dock points there. Additionally, I was still able to find a great beer to satisfy me. We also ordered two carafes of wine which was top tier.

The food! Bacon wrapped dates were incredible and rich, the burrata and eggplant caponata was bright and light and paired with some fantastic bread, the LA crawfish grilled cheese was also rich and quite tasty while paired with a side of Cajun carrots that were unique, truffle fries were your run of the mill truffle fry experience, and the cornflake chicken sandwich was uhhhhh bland and not seasoned and the only bad part of our meal.

Pros: our waitress (I wish I could remember her name), the decorations, music, outdoor patio, the burrata and eggplant caponata, wine selection, the zony mash sour beer I settled on

She never came back there after. We had to ask someone else ten minutes later can we order our food. He then proceeds to respond with ""we're back up and we make drinks for everyone in here but I'm here now."" Okay. We ordered. Twenty minutes goes by (no food) the young lady who first assisted us comes over to us, takes a drink menu from us to assist someone else and doesn't say a thing. This was beyond unacceptable and disrespectful. No ""excuse me"" or anything. Mind you, she never came back for our food order either (we asked her for a food menu.) I asked for a manager at that point since it is rude to reach over someone without saying anything for one, and two, she never even acknowledged us since then. Manager came over to remedy what was left of the situation which did nothing because I was ready to completely walk out. The young lady came over (because of the manager obviously at this point) to check on us. We completely ignored her. The guy who we gave our food order to came over more frequently as well to check on us. Had we been told by either of them, ""we're very busy, but we'll get to you as soon as possible,"" we would have completely understood. However, that was not the case. We believe this is happened to us because we are African American women and this establishment is served predominantly Caucasians.

 Looking for an intimate space and a good time? @coppervinewinepub is located right on Postseason. This sleek spot is very comfortable and up to date with a beautiful, fun courtyard.

 For cocktails, I ordered the lavender sprits with Magnolia vodka, elderflower liqueur, lemon, lavender simple syrup, and Lambrusco. Simply put it was a lavender and tonic lol.

 For lunch, I started with the "" Jumbo Lump Crab Deviled Eggs"". They seem to have a strong mustard and pepper taste. I also ordered the ""filet mignon brochette"" which was cooked very nicely and accompanied with wild mushrooms. The sweet pepper whipped garlic forest glaze was the perfect pair.

 For my main course, I ordered the Wagyu burger with Brussels sprouts! Listen the burger was extremely juicy, with the perfect choice of gruyere cheese and served on a soft burger bun. I was so happy ! The brussels sprouts were cooked great and the garlic aïoli was awesome. I even put a little on my bun!

The server came out, unceremoniously dropped the board down and spun on her heels without a word of explanation of what was on it, and we looked down and there was literally a total of an ounce of three tiny slivers of cheese sitting there.  That's it!  The bill for five cocktails, fries, & cheese board was $100 including the tip.

In a town of fabulous craft cocktails everywhere you go & restaurants opening & closing on a weekly basis, their game is lame and duck fat fries can't be the only thing carrying you.

i was here recently for a friends birthday, and it's a great place to go to to celebrate! it's very nice and fancy, and the food and drinks are pretty good too. the price point is a bit high, so i personally would only go here for special occasions 

i split a charcuterie board and rose sangria with the table, and the my were both delicious! the 3 meats, 3 cheeses board was *just* enough for 6 people and had some really tasty meats and cheeses. we did have a cheddar that was super sharp, and i think that was the only cheese that didn't get fully eaten 

the rose sangria was delicious! it came with a lot of ice though - like A LOT - probably because they want to give you less alcohol... it was super good but about 65% of our pitcher was ice, which is not so good

i got the croque madam for my main dish, and it was good but the ham and sauce were both a little too salty for my taste personally. but i had a bite of my friend's wagyu burger and it was so so good! cooked super well and also very well seasoned

so imo the dishes are hit or miss, the charcuterie board was great, and the drinks are kind of a rip off but they're tasty if you're willing to pay!",YNjyv0gfOr2g8lbmUpTnKg,Copper Vine,New Orleans,4.5,-90.0744274301,29.9506467229,"Nightlife, Pubs, Event Planning & Services, Wine Bars, Bars, Gastropubs, Restaurants, Venues & Event Spaces","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '10:30-22:0', 'Sunday': '10:30-21:0'}",1001 Poydras St,LA

Get separate plates and go ahead and cut things down the middle. Usually their sandwiches already come cut!

We got the lump crab deviled eggs, LA crawfish grilled cheese, the goat cheese and fig flatbread, and the soup of the day. It was alot of food but so good.

The menu via UberEats is pared down from what I see on their main website. Not sure if that's an app limitation, or just an inventory issue when I placed the order. In any case, what was offered seemed very appealing to me and my family. We ordered two of their take on the Impossible Burger, their Waygu Beef Burger, their Copper Vine Cuban sandwich, and the Baby Herbs Salad. After placing the order, my wife and I went back to the distraction of streaming TV. After probably 20 minutes or so, I got an alert from my UberEats driver that there was an issue and he would be delayed. I called the restaurant and was told that the chef wasn't happy with the presentation of one of my entrees and was remaking it. I thought to myself, ""Wow, perfection during a pandemic. That's a good sign."" ... and I have to say I was more than happy with the food. When it did arrive a short while later, my family was more than happy with the quality and presentation of the food.

1503,3.0,"Unfortunately, I had to give it 3/5 because of the fries and the shrimps. They were just too salty. 

The pork belly and fried oysters tasted unexpectedly pretty good together. The sweetness from the cha siu complimented the oysters. When you eat any type of seafood, there will be this fishy taste to it. Due to the bbq flavor from the cha siu, I didn't taste any fishiness from the oysters. 

The herbed mushroom pasta only came with a poached egg, so I decided to add the shrimps for some protein. Big mistake. I love salty food, but the grilled shrimps were just too way salty. The mushroom pasta itself tasted delicious. Maybe that's why I should not add any extra topping. 

The tequila mule was really good. I love cocktails that do not just straight up taste like alcohol. If they put too little alcohol, you won't be able to smell it. If they put too much, then the alcohol taste will be too overwhelming. The tequila mule was just perfect. It was sweet, strong, and ready ""to kill ya"".

Cooper Vine is super chill and has a restaurant vibe to it, because it is a restaurant. I went for a work event and we had a private space upstairs. We ended doing a 4 wine flight where our servers brought unmarked bottles to the tables and we had to guess which wine we were consuming. 
Half glasses start off at $4-$5 and most bottles range from $36-$54 with wines from the east coast to the west coast and your usual South American, European , and South African wines. 
What I did not expect was to love the food. It was sooo good. We started off with french fries, deviled eggs and Brussels sprouts, which was absolutely divine. The Brussels are fried then baked and served with grated Parmesan. They were sooo good that you did not need the sauce that accompanied the sprouts. We also had a few different flatbreads which were all delicious! My favorite was the pulled pork flatbread with caramelized onions. 
The staff all seemed to really enjoy their job and were super helpful and friendly. My group definitely wanted to come back again for brunch, but rest assured the brunch menu will be available within the next couple of weeks and they will be available for brunch on both Saturdays and Sundays.

We ordered wine and apps and got the apps before the wine. We were 100% done with all our appetizers before our server came back to take our main order.

When we told him a second time and he seemed snarky. We all ended up ordering soup for our mains because we had such a long time after completing our apps we weren't really hungry anymore. Good for us (because we would have over ordered) bad for him (because his ppa went down and way less of a tip.) When our mains came two of us were splitting the poutine (cochon au lait debris fries) and while the plate was scorching the food inside was luke warm at best. We would have brought it up but he never asked if the food was good. He was MIA the rest of the meal (not that he was very present to begin with.) Or even friendly when he was present. Oh and eventually our other wine came but that took forever too. It was also very hard for us to get gross dirty plates taken away from the table. The French shallot(onion) soup had decent flavor but it was a tiny little dollop of cheese (not your normal smother in cheese and then baked French onion soup) floating on a Very chewy stale piece of bread that I couldn't cut at all.  Three cheese gnocchi was good. Although pretty watery and he didn't bring a spoon until I flagged him down about 10 minutes later. Over all not a fan.

Came to Copper Vine for Sunday brunch. Love the ambiance here and the patio area! My expectations were high as I've greatly anticipated dining here for quite some time. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, took his time to explain things, and made quality recommendations. For an appetizer, I had the filet mignon brochette as the waiter suggested; it was fantastic! It definitely set the bar. While waiting for our entrees (yes, my friend and I both ordered 2 entrees, don't judge), we occupied our time indulging in the bottomless mimosas which were also great. 

Entrees: I had the chicken and waffles as well as the crawfish and andouille gnocchi. The chicken was really good and paired well with the gravy that came with it. However, I was greatly underwhelmed by the waffle. It was super thin and crispy, almost like a wafer. I prefer thicker, more fluffy waffles. I ate the chicken and played over the waffle for those reasons. As for the gnocchi, I was not impressed at all. It was disappointing for me. My friend also got the chicken and waffles in addition to the Apple fritter French toast which said was phenomenal.

Service was great, as expected. I ate once before at the bar before but have returned with my fiancée. We came during Coolinary month and Copper Vine's selection didn't disappoint. We shared the appetizer and dessert. This isn't a traditional New Orleans cuisine, but you can certainly taste the influences. Flavors are a bit more light and fresh rather than spicy and in your face. The chicken and boudin gumbo appetizer was not mom's gumbo, but pretty good. Paige got the Wagyu burger while I got the Gulf Fish Bouillabaisse. Both great. The Strawberries & Cream Bread Pudding was GREAT. I'm pretty sure it was garnished with champgne strawberries.

Fast forward to the next day...I arrived and lo and behold there wasn't an outdoor table available. I didn't want to inconvenience the others in my party, so we agreed to sit inside. At first, there appeared to be adequate social distancing. BUT no one inside was wearing a mask or required to wear one while not eating. About 30 minutes later, the place was well over 100% capacity. There were way too many people in there and no one was masked, except me and another at my table. Most of the staff had on masks, except one guy who stood by our table for a loooooong time talking to another employee. I was really uncomfortable. 

Now on to the food. I ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was big! The pork was delicious but the ham could have been better in my opinion. Overall, I'd give the sandwich a 3.5. I upgraded my fries to the truffle fries. They were good but I feel I only got enough to go with one half of my sandwich. My friend had the ancient grain and sugarcane salad, add oysters. It looked delicious and she said it was!

We decided to pay using the QR code on the receipt. After submitting payment, we realized we didn't have the option to tip.

1541,2.0,"I reserved a table for a Saturday night dinner for a bachelorette group. When I made the reservation I asked about vegan options because I didn't see anything on the menu. The person who took the reservation assured me there were vegan menu items so I assumed the menu online was outdated or didn't have all items listed.

When we arrived at the restaurant, I was disappointed that our vaccine cards weren't checked- there was no request for anything like that. We waited for a few minutes in a lounge area near the bathroom before being seated, and were seated pretty quickly after that. We placed drink orders and then a lot of time went by while we waited to order appetizers. I eventually had to get up to ask someone if we could place an appetizer order. 

When ordering dinner, I asked about the vegan options. The only menu item that is vegan as-is was a bowl of olives. Our server said there were no vegan options. I asked her if she could check with the kitchen because the person that took the reservation was very reassuring about vegan items. She came back and said they could do a vegetable plate with ""what we have in house."" When I asked, she said it was carrots and green beans. I asked if there were possibly grains or beans in addition to the veggies? Nope. Just two veggies apparently. I let her know how disappointed I was she was defensive and not apologetic or kind about it at all. I would have expected more from a restaurant that has a chef in-house, especially when it was not busy in the restaurant, and because I had called ahead. 

I ended up getting a salad without bacon and cheese (of course it is the same price without those ingredients - hello vegan tax!) and having some fries left over from our appetizers. It reminded me of the early 2000s when fries and a side salad were the only meat-free items I could order at most restaurants. 

The best part of my meal (aside from spending time with my friends!) was two wonderful glasses of wine. The food and especially the service was so underwhelming.

I've been here three times, and I've grown to like it more and more with each visit.

The wine options are very solid. I appreciate the fact that they are not so numerous as to be overbearing: I typically don't like being presented with a long list of wines that doesn't seem particularly curated. For each wine type, they have 1-3 options at different price points. Another great selling point is that you can try each wine in different sizes; in other words, you don't have to fully commit to any one wine if you want to be more experimental.

The food offerings are delicious. I've gotten a few flatbreads and have never been disappointed. The duck fat fries are mouthwatering. For entrées, I've only gotten the bouillabaisse, but it exceeded my expectations. 

The food can seem a little pricey, but it is honestly on par with the area. Additionally, the wines are reasonably priced and there is a good happy hour special.

I especially love sitting in the outdoor courtyard area, which is great for a warm spring afternoon. I've tried a variety of their small plates and really enjoyed the Brussels sprouts (obviously) and the flat breads. Copper Vine is a great spot to grab drinks and snacks after work for people who work in the CBD or before a show at the super dome/ smoothie king center. I highly recommend making a reservation if you are trying to get a table before a popular concert because it gets very packed. They also have happy hour on their bottles of wine (I've heard that they have happy hour on some snacks but that wasn't the case when I visited). I'll definitely be back!

1563,2.0,"Thought I had written a review already but maybe I cut them some slack and decided against a bad review after my first visit.  Second try and this place just doesn't do it for me so it's story time.  Cause I'm in quarantine so this review is going to be a long one. 

Spark notes: Expensive bad food. 

I remember when they opened. So happy to see the skeezy place before it replaced.  Like a basic bitch I oooed at the thought of cocktails in the beautiful outdoor courtyard. 

If you're not with your gal pals, you're on a date.  That's just the type of place this is.  Like I said the courtyard is insta worthy and if you didn't happen to notice, the building preserved its historic charm.  Stand on poydras and admire those beams... 

Unfortunately, that's where my love ends.  The first experience, a date, was disappointing to say the least.  Not the date, the food. Which is worse. Bad date I can handle, bad food? No ma'am. 

You're in a beautiful courtyard what do you order? Charcuterie of course.  Let's feel like we're under the Tuscan sun surrounded by grape leaves... 

Back to reality, you're in New Orleans and this meat and cheese plate is nothing like Italy.  Forget fresh prosciutto or cheese from a sheep.  They can't even serve bread that's not stale.  Before you hiss at me, yes crostini is toasted.  I know the difference. My date and I agreed, this hard bread just wasn't going to do.  After waiting longer than I'd like for food that doesn't require cooking, we got more bread but there was no difference.  I'm sure we ate some other stuff but it wasn't memorable.

After first experience left me unimpressed, we never went back.  We would drive by and comment about our bad memory. Expensive bad food. 

Fast forward to Quarantine 2020.  I'm surfing IG because that's honestly all I do now. Some places are starting to offer family meals. We eat out often so more food for less money sounds like a good plan.  

20% off food at copper vine, let's give it another try. I called to place an order and the person answering the phone was not aware of family meals and when I asked about todays was told it's pork chops not pulled pork? Unfortunately I ordered from some where else.  This place upset me again. 

Is there a character limit on these reviews??? If you're still reading you must be in quarantine still. 

So I decide to say something about it. Cause I've never been one to keep my mouth shut.  Sent them a DM on IG.  Fast response. So sorry for the confusion. How about a free meal? Sweet! Yes please.  Never asked my name...Swing by to pick up my meal prepared for the worst.  Manager must have been expecting me.  Although my order was for a specific pick up time, I might as well have ordered when I got there. Ended up waiting 20mins and there were zero other people waiting. 

Time to eat. Fried Fish, Mac, green beans, bread pudding.  Edible. Certainly not worth normal price tag. Bread pudding was beyond dry.  This is where their stale bread could come in handy yet they somehow made it more dry... drench that shit in whiskey sauce and eat my free meal.  

The strong will (hopefully) survive this quarantine.  I'd be shocked if it's copper vine.",YNjyv0gfOr2g8lbmUpTnKg,Copper Vine,New Orleans,4.5,-90.0744274301,29.9506467229,"Nightlife, Pubs, Event Planning & Services, Wine Bars, Bars, Gastropubs, Restaurants, Venues & Event Spaces","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '10:30-22:0', 'Sunday': '10:30-21:0'}",1001 Poydras St,LA

The interior of the restaurant itself is very nice. The host greeted us and we told him we would like to sit at the bar, which is just first come first serve. We sat down and it took 10 minutes (I timed it bc it was taking so long) before the bartender even came up to us to only hand us food menus and walk away, didn't even get the drink one I had to grab one near me. Even then he didn't greet us or smile and didn't even say he would be right with us or if we had any questions to let him know. It was a very unpleasant beginning and start to our date night. We just felt unwelcomed to be there. I don't know if it's because he was the only bartender or if it was that busy, but I think he could've at the very least acknowledged us when we sat down right in front of him or told us he would be right with us. I was trying to give the situation the benefit of the doubt the whole dinner, but nothing got better because it did eventually slow down. He simply took our orders and handed us our orders.

Food: Charcuterie Tray 

Drinks: Frose and HH Rose

Pros: HH Rose - not to sweet and it packed a punch, Charcuterie Tray - super tasty, the atmosphere

1578,4.0,"The Food: Stopped in with a few co-workers. We ordered the Margherita flatbread and Brussel sprouts for apps. We also shared the Milky Way dessert. I ordered the pick two option, which consisted of 1/2 fried shrimp po-boy and gumbo. 

The flatbread, brussel sprouts and dessert were off the chain! I highly recommend and would order again. The crust of the flatbread was crispy. The red sauce was perfect, not too sour and not too sweet, but jussst right. It was cheesy and the fresh tomatoes were on point. I love brussel sprouts done right and these did not disappoint. Firm and roasted in olive oil. Is that bacon I taste? I don't know, but I wanted seconds. The presentation of the Milky Way was too cute. It had chocolate fudge and blondie/brownie bites, popcorn and honey roasted peanuts, on rings of caramel. All surrounding a center of orange chocolate ice cream from the Creole Creamery. I don't remember the exact name of the ice cream, though. 

My fried shrimp po-boy was good. The bread was toasted and the shrimp were seasoned. The pepper jelly glaze was a nice touch. They applied it with restraint, so the flavor wasn't overpowering. I would opt for the full sandwich next time. The gumbo was earthy with a dark roux. It reminded me of the gumbo my high school served. It was missing the rice and grilled cheese sandwich like the high school version, though. The andouille was good, but they were a bit stingy with only one piece. I think the meat was mostly turkey, which left a lot to be desired. I would've preferred smoked sausage, shrimp or more andouille. Overall, it was a good meal.

The Ambiance: This is one lovely restaurant. I would use it as inspiration to redesign my family room. The colors--navy, copper orange, tan--furniture, fabrics and decor were all breathtaking. I felt at home. It was bright and airy. They also have a cute and sizable patio for outdoor dining.

1579,4.0,"A Sunday off from work? The perfect opportunity for me to enjoy brunch for once! Weather strikes again and my courtyard reservation had to be moved inside! I arrived early to my reservation, and while many tables had recently been moved indoors because of the weather, the hosts were happy to acknowledge my table would be opening up momentarily. At the bar, I ordered the Gentle Sage (gin, grapefruit, sage) that I had seen online and the manager ensured my drink would be added to my tables tab. I was really impressed by the staff's hospitality and flexibility due to the weather and how an event like that can really throw a wrench in the gears for a small place. 
The dining room was LOUD! It's definitely a hot spot for brunching babes, so I hope to return when the weather isn't so spotty to sit outdoors.
Our server Rebecca was attentive and upbeat, happy to share personal recommendations and ensure our drinks were plentiful.
The menu is expansive and it was hard to choose, so I kept my paper copy to check off the things I had tried, and want to try. A nice detail were the notations indicating vegetarian, and gluten free options! 
We shared the bacon wrapped dates (slap yo momma!), tuna tartare and the sunflower seed salad (I really delighted in the toasty seeds and shaved cheese-not a salad I'd pick outright so it was a delight!)
For mains, we tried the truffle and thyme frittata and the small mushroom pasta with added lump crab. My runny egg was hard boiled but thankfully not over cooked and there was no way I'd be sending my dish back just for the egg. If they are sous vide poached eggs, I hope they recalibrate.
The wine was delicious and the variety of pour sizes was a nice option if you wanted to bounce around and try your palette out on several varietals. However, the standard 5 oz pours are pricey and I didn't see any drink specials that might assist your wallet.

Finally got around to visiting for brunch a few weeks ago and it did not disappoint. We were able to sit in their cute courtyard and enjoy the nice weather. All staff were masked and the tables were decently spaced out. 

The brunch options were most pleasing; it was a little hard to choose. We decided to start with the jump lump crab deviled eggs which were light and a great way to open the meal. The crab was fresh and it was a great twist on a classic favorite. For our meals, I settled on the Apple Fritter French Toast and my friend got the Cochon De Lait Benny. 

That french toast? *chef's kiss*. The bread was thick and held up really well against the caramelized fruit and syrup. The pecans offered a nice crunch that broke up some of the richness of the dish. If you're into more sweet/dessert-style brunch options, get this! I wish I could have eaten more but I didn't want to overstuff myself. The Benny was equally as delicious. I loved that their take on it with using a grit cake instead of an English muffin or biscuit. The pork was tender and flavorful and the greens were rather tasty for a restaurant.

1582,4.0,"LOVE that the old Maylie's space has a restaurant that is as beautiful as it was... OK Maylie's (which closed in the 80s was kind of run down but it was still beautiful and that wisteria vine was gorgeous in the spring). Definitely a 5 star space especially considering the last incarnation that was here.

My review is for the brunch menu only. The menu was interesting and had some variety to it. The winner was the dutch baby pancake... that lemon curd was to die for. Even my friend who isn't into sweet breakfast was swayed. One friend had the crab cakes which she said were good but was raving about the duck fat potatoes underneath. The other friend had the couchon and grits. And I had the smoked salmon and egg. So here's the thing each of our dishes had a poached egg and none of the eggs were poached properly. All the yolks were set and for one of us the yolk was set but the white was somehow undercooked. It was weird. 

For my salmon dish, it was tasty and the salmon was well cooked and not overly salty, but the hollandaise (of which there was maybe a tablespoon) was only on the egg, when the salmon could have used the moisture. I think the dish could be excellent with a bit better plating and egg cookage. 

Our drinks were tasty (mimosas and an old fashioned). And they were offering a Veuve special which we did not participate in. One of my friends has been to their happy hour and said it was great but they don't have any information on that on their website. 

Service brings this above a 3 since our server was hustling especially after the restaurant filled up by midday.

The fish dish was entirely flavorless, ""charcuterie"" salad was basically uncooked bacon that was slimy and cold and the deviled eggs were so bad, I ended up coming home and making my own. To make matters worse, the place was crawling with bachelorette parties which totally crunched the vibe and when the manager did come by and basically made me explain why I wasn't eating the salad, he didn't even bother to apologize. Instead he said ""oh, you don't like MY pork?!""... I was blown away after having that experience discussing it, he didn't even bother to take it off the bill or bring over a glass of champs to apologize, as it was flowing down the gullets (for $20 bottomless) of everyone in the joint. Extremely overpriced for the less-than-flavorful experience and wouldnt come back after that. Oh yeah, and the waiter tipped himself 20%, which is typically what I would tip except sort of presumtive considering we went without waters or drinks for long lulls and watched a beer sit at the bar for over ten minutes.

We all took a different approach to drinking; I went with their happy hour flight of house white, rosé, and red, and liked them all. Another tasted two reds and chose the second. The beer drinker did a beer flight, which meant three 12-oz pours, instead of the five or six smaller servings I expected.

I, on the other hand, agonized between several things before going for the crawfish grilled cheese sandwich on the advice of our server. I loved it!

That morning we had the Brussels sprouts, the Apple fritter French toast and the cochon du lait benedict. All were pure heaven. Even though technically not part of the proposal, I can promise you this food makes it into every recounting of the story.

We visited during coolinary, so there was a special coolinary menu you could order off of if wanted (you could also order from the normal menu).  I chose the french onion soup, croque madame, and the dessert beignets.  Every single item was delicious and decadent.  The beignets were the best I've ever had - they are light, airy, and puffy on the inside instead of heavy like they are at Cafe Du Monde.

1617,5.0,"Had never been to Copper Vine for brunch, but they accommodated a large party of 9 for a special occasion. They initially had us placed at separate tables, but the manager quickly rectified this for us. I had only been for dinner and the brunch menu had a lot of the same overlap of some items. 

The duck debris fries are a MUST GET. they were devoured immediately. The flatbreads are also a great choice! I wish I had stuck to getting some small plates as my entree because the crab Benedict just didn't really do it for me. There was no flavor/spice in the tomato-sherry Holland size and just was a really bland dish unfortunately. I tried the waffle with the chicken & waffle and it was tasty, so maybe I just picked the wrong dish. 

Definitely won't fault them for that, but just a heads up for those planning to visit CV for brunch in the future :)",YNjyv0gfOr2g8lbmUpTnKg,Copper Vine,New Orleans,4.5,-90.0744274301,29.9506467229,"Nightlife, Pubs, Event Planning & Services, Wine Bars, Bars, Gastropubs, Restaurants, Venues & Event Spaces","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '10:30-22:0', 'Sunday': '10:30-21:0'}",1001 Poydras St,LA

1620,5.0,"I will be returning. Because I just still cannot believe I enjoyed EVERYTHING I tried at Copper Vine. Yes I am a bit animated but I'm not exaggerating my experience--I truly recommend this place! Me and my friends came here for Saturday brunch to celebrate a birthday so we had it on our mind to spend some $$$. The restaurant is gorgeous. The patio was to die for; I didn't know if i wanted to sit inside, at the bar, on the patio or on the balcony (yes balcony!). Our server Justin was amazing. From the first introduction we fell in love with their personality. Great service really makes a good place a great one. Antonio also helped us towards the end of our visit. They were both funny, knowledgeable & provided great service  

We got bottomless mimosas and I swear we never saw the bottom of our glasses.... That was a first! Most places make you buy a bottle and call it ""bottomless"" or give you a glass or two but here you will keep getting that champagne refill until you LEAVE. And in great Louisiana fashion you can take your mimosa to go :) okay let me get to the food

Apps:
- Jumbo lump crab deviled eggs
- Black truffle fries
- Filet mignonette brochette (Our FAV! The mushrooms were the best part... seasoned & cooked to perfection wow)
- Pork belly & corn fried oysters (least favorite but it was not bad. I would just recommend the other apps if it's your first time)

Entrees:
- Jump lump crab Benny (our server Justin recommended this for me! I added steak on the side also) 

Cocktails:
- Bottomless mimosas (we had orange juice, cranberry, & pineapple juice. All yummy but the pineapple juice was an all around fav because of how fresh it tasted) 

- Everything's Coming Up Roses: I usually stray away from floral drinks because it's too overwhelming or not blended well but I surprisingly enjoyed this mix. Told Justin to send my compliments to the bartender fr ahah! 

Of course after we left someone told me I should've tried the beignets smh.

I was very thankful of the seating because it sat away from everyone in the restaurant and gave me a nice quaint spot to catch up on some of my work. I would give 5 stars but my food took a while to come out. My entree took nearly 45 minutes- however it was well worth the wait. I ordered the Crab Benny and it was such a delicious flavorful dish. Jasmine was very sweet and funny. She was very apologetic and even remarked that she ""had to go and cook the food herself"". She kept the atmosphere light and I did not feel rushed.

Besides being extremely picture worthy, the food is really good too. It's rare that you can find a brunch spot that checks off all the boxes on my checklist. 

I think people are starting to take notice of this gem, so if you are thinking about checking it out be sure to make reservations. For this brunch I didn't go with a typical mimosa. I went with a sweet red wine called Lambrusco Dolce Fiore and it was delicious. 

We started off with snacks the LA Crawfish Beignets and the Jumbo Lump Crabmeat Deviled Eggs! I especially loved the beignets, the eggs were okay. I mean I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, after all it's just a deviled egg.

My cousin and God-Daughter got the Wild Shrimp and Grits which included Sauce Piquante, Roasted Peppers and Pickled Onions. They both enjoyed it but my God-Baby eats like an adult..haha.

The patio with amble seating and vines is like a little oasis in the busy area of the city. The dining area is open and well lit with airy space and windows. There are long dining tables and two seaters available. We simply sat at the bar where we had the most delightful server tend to us. He was friendly and engaging, and that just added to the experience. We ordered wine and two shareables - the filet mignon brochette and the fig and goat cheese flatbread.

The food was pretty good and the service was ok - it wasn't packed when we went and the food took forever but it was pretty nice when we finally got to eat. 

I love the atmosphere and decor of Copper Vine. It's much bigger than what it initially looks like outside, but I'm learning during my NOLA visit that there are multiple restaurants that have levels to them. Pretty cool!

We ordered the margherita flatbread and it was not that impressive. It had a good crunch to it but looked dismal. Unlimited mimosas here for like $25. 

I ordered the quiche with crab and it was really tasty - I wish it was bigger!!! The arugula salad on the side was so fresh too. 

The gnocchi was probably the best serving I've ever had - usually it's pretty soggy and hard to get through but this had such good flavor and texture.

Our reservation was ready right when we got there and we sat in the upstairs dining room! Not very loud and a great view! Their menu was so hard to pick from! My party ended up sharing a bunch of appetizers since we couldn't choose just a few! 

1. Tuna tartare and caviar- amazing! My favorite appetizer out of all 6. Flavor is amazing and it spreads so easily on the crackers! Love that it comes with avocado on the bottom! 
2. Pork belly and corn fried oysters- loved these so much! Flavor was great and loved that they came with blue cheese crumbles and ranch! They come in an order of 3, but the ones we got were quite small. Taste was amazing though! 
3. Bianca flatbread- so delicious. More on the plain side on the flatbread options, so we decided to add charcuterie! Definitely added flavor to it! It was cheesy and delish! 
4. Bacon wrapped dates- I love seeing dates on a menu, I was excited to see them served at copper vine. They were warm and delicious! The syrup on top really made them worth it! If you don't like dates, I would still try it! The bacon flavor really changes the way you will think about dates! 
5. Burrata and heirloom tomatoes- literally mouth watering. My second favorite thing and maybe even tied with the tuna! The burrata and tomato mixture was just so good. The cheese was so creamy and the tomatoes had so much flavor. It came with crispy pieces of bread that made the whole burrata experience! 
6. Gnocchi Au gratin- this was good but very heavy. When it came out, it looked like baked Mac n cheese! I like that the top was crunchy and the inside was creamy. This app will fill you up fast if you have too much though! 

Of course we did pair some wines with our apps, and they were so good as well. If you like sweet drinks, their sangrias will be perfect for you!

1656,5.0,"We had the most superlative experience at chic Copper Vine last night. It started a few weeks ago when requested space for a private party with 25 people within a certain budget. Not only did Mike speedily respond with the friendliest invitation and enthusiasm for our event, he kept up that standard of communication every time we emailed asking for this or that small tweak as our final guest count kept wavering and the party's dietary restrictions filtered in. He provided a quick solution at each turn. 

The food and drink menu choices he offered blew me away with the variety and creativity. Terrific balance of regional specialties and nouveau cuisine choices. I was able to make selections to accommodate all of our known food issues among guests while having a spectacular menu. The contract process was smooth and split up into two payments which made spreading out the cost very convenient. Furthermore the contract was very clearly spelled out and perfectly aligned with my own math, no surprises! 

The service itself was unparalleled. Antonio and Dylan meticulously made sure no one's beverage was empty. They accommodated ad-hock special requests (no mushrooms on one, allowing another guest to order something not on the pre-arranged menu) with cheerful professionalism. With each of the 4 courses, it seemed as though we were all magically served each plate at once. They made sure my mom - the guest of honor - felt honored without provoking any fear of a humiliating public fuss over her birthday. These gentlemen have mastered their craft. 

Onto the food! MY LORD AND ALL THE SAINTS IN HEAVEN was the culinary portion of the party beyond. Beyond what? Everything, that's what. Course 1: We started with caprese skewers - perfectly proportioned with just enough balsamic glaze to pop the flavors of the basil, cheese, and perfectly ripe pretty tomatoes. The goat cheese fig flatbread was another masterpiece of balanced flavors and texture. Course 2: The gumbo was flavorful, obviously made with a rich roux, but light enough to reasonably be a mere amuse-bouche leading up to the stars of the show. However my favorite was the arugula sunflower salad. It's bright citrusy front notes perfectly transitioned into the fresh peppery notes and cool texture of the arugula. Course 3: Wild Shrimp and Grits. Utterly swoon worthy. The alternate Herb-roasted wild mushroom pasta served with a sous-vide egg that upped the intensity of the creamy velvety delightful texture was sheer brilliance. The only reason I didn't finish mine was anticipation of Course 4: Bananas Foster Rum Cake. I swear you will never experience it's equal anywhere else. I'm still fantasizing about it a day later. 

This was truly the event of a lifetime. Every detail was thought of. They care the took to elevate my mother's birthday celebration into an elegant yet festive and intimate epic experience my family will remember forever deserves a loud round of applause. I wish I could nominate them for whatever the equivalent of an Oscar would be in their industry. 

The very last touch of the evening was discreetly  presenting me with a substantial card stock version of the personalized menu cards as my party was saying their goodbyes before dispersing home across the country.

We ask for menu recommendations, and learned that you truly could not go wrong with anything you ordered. We were told that bottomless brunch was available for $25 per person and that each person needed a meal in order to be served. That worked for us because it was exactly what we planned to do. We were brought small carafes of orange juice and cranberry juice and Antonio filled our glasses with champagne.

To eat, we shared the black truffle fries, bacon wrapped dates, crawfish beignets, and bianca flatbread. For our mains,  a friend and I shared the crab benedict and apple fritter french toast. The bacon wrapped dates were incredible, and we were able to add an additional piece to make it 4 instead of the 3 it usually comes with. Others tried the Ancient Grains Salad and the Shakshuka.

My party of 4 had a 6pm reservation for Saturday night. Taylor was our server and she was the bomb.com. She recognized my party had a lot of catching up to do and gave us plenty of time to decide on drinks and food without becoming impatient. 

We started with individual 8oz carafes and as the night went on, opted for the bottle of the nectar of the God's aka the Grenache Rose on the menu.  One guest in our party had a couple of Sazeracs followed by some Crying Eagle beers (he's an Eagles fan, so it fits, ha!)

We ordered shareable apps: the charcuterie board (is it a GNO if you didn't have a cheeseboard?), brussel sprouts, and duck fat fries. All yum! For dinner, my gals ordered the margherita flatbread, the burger, and I had the club sandwich. I'll embarrassingly admit that I can't recall how it was because I was *turnt* but, I'm sure it was delicious! 

Service was top notch! In addition to Taylor being our main server, we had other staff bring our food, clear plates, refill waters very promptly. 

Our bill was..well, reflective of a good time. Pro tip: try to convince yourself to start with the bottle instead of ordering individual glasses.. you'll get there eventually, and it'll probably end up saving you a few $$.

For a drink I ordered a frozen Rose' it was good because I am a light weight but to others it may taste like a strawberry flavored icee. The drink was very beautiful when it arrived with a strawberry and cucumber for a garnish. 
Appetizers, we ordered pork belly, carrots, dates, stuffed beignets. The pork belly was delicious! The carrots could have used a little more time roasting as they were a bit crunchy. I didn't try the dates, they were wrapped in bacon. 
Entree I orders the lump crab Benny. None of the flavor actually stood up. The biscuit did not taste fresh and the egg didn't really have flavor.

1671,2.0,"NO WAY is this a 4+ Star restaurant.  Five of us with a reservation on a Saturday night.  It was 6pm we were on the early side they weren't slammed yet.  Appetizers took forever. Crawfish beignet were fine a little stringy, considerable filler.  The carrots were fine too. Black truffle fries were crap.  Heavily doubt that the fires were made in house.  It would legitimately would have been better to doordash fries from McDonalds or Wendys to get a better quality fry with ""truffle"" oil on them.  

We got three salads that were fine, but WHY o WHY did they think it was OK to drop the entree's on the table about 90 seconds after the salads arrived.  That is a cardinal sin of table serving. Stacking freshly prepared food in front of a diner and forcing them to choose: 1) let something get stale or cold, 2) make a fuss and ask them to take it back (it's just going to sit under a heat lamp) if you make them cook it fresh, then wait 30 minutes while the rest of your party eats uncomfortably.  TWO of us had salads before our entree and be both had hot food crowding out or place setting with a full salad sitting in front of us. 

The Gulf Fish Almondine was truly weird and worse for it.  Fish almondine should be cooked in a pan with a butter sauce -- or broiled or baked -- with a garnish of almonds.  I understand artistic riffs on this that can still be excellent.  But if you promote yourself as a seafood town because you're next to the ocean, why would you create a fish almondine that has a HARD, THICK batter that totally overpowers a delicate protein like fish?  It made no sense and the crust really took away from a nice piece of fish.  It says ""champagne cream sauce""  Delicate, right?  NOWHERE on the menu does it say that this dish with a classic name was not going to be prepared classically and have an unacceptably thick breading on it.  

honestly, if they hadn't rushed the entrees on top of the salad or at LEAST apologized, I would have gone another star.  But we did everything right -- made a rez, waited patiently when things were slow, didn't raise hell with awful service errors -- and they did too many things wrong.",YNjyv0gfOr2g8lbmUpTnKg,Copper Vine,New Orleans,4.5,-90.0744274301,29.9506467229,"Nightlife, Pubs, Event Planning & Services, Wine Bars, Bars, Gastropubs, Restaurants, Venues & Event Spaces","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '10:30-22:0', 'Sunday': '10:30-21:0'}",1001 Poydras St,LA

I don't even like blue cheese but it works in this dish. Had the crawfish beignets. Great. Bacon wrapped dates very nice. Ordered gnocci and loved it. Great flavor and mix. She had some pasta dish.

With so few options, I did take advantage of half off a bottle of their white blend wine (which is usually $45 but $24 on HH). Crazy right? I've never seen a bottle of white blend wine that was $45.

1696,3.0,"COPPERVINE! One of the new places you're probably hearing about from wine lovers. This place is still fairly new, and right now, it's being talked about by a lot! My friends and I wanted to try this spot during the Mardi Gras week and see what it's all about. 

The place looks great! Just right on Poydras, this place has a pretty fair selection of wines to try and food and snacks to munch on! The place inside was packed, and for some reason, their upstairs rooms were not open that day, so we had to sit outside during the night. It was fairly cold, and disappointingly, there were no lights outside and no heaters. However, the outside looked great and the soft chairs were pretty comfortable to sit on and relax. A lot of us ordered different wines and mixed drinks. We also ordered Herb Roasted mushroom pasta, Short rib, Wagyu Burger, Duck Fat Fries, 3 Pork Bellies, and a Smoked Salmon. 

First off, I could appreciate the selection of wines they had to offer, not bad at all. They also had a ""Flight"" option where you can try a small amount of 3 different wines. What shocked me was that these wines were sort of expensive. The server that brought out the ""Flights"" for my friends got a lot of the wines mixed up and was confused on who ordered what, sort of disappointing. As for the food, most of it was pretty lackluster, but not bad. The Duck Fat fries were $8 and it was nothing more but fries with a little cheese on top. EASY pass. We ordered 3 orders of the Pork Belly, but the dishes were inconsistent. My dish in particular was surrounded by a sauce while the other 2 didn't. I didn't know what the dish was supposed to look like. The Pasta was overcooked and lacked some flavour. The short ribs were nothing more that just shirt ribs to be honest. Lacking in flavour and just pretty underwhelming. If the burger did not have the Wagyu name in it, I would've just thought it was a regular burger, which it pretty much is, again, underwhelming. And finally.. that SALMON was $16!! The salmon was TINY and it came with about 5 pieces of small toast to share. Again, pretty standard, yet , EXPENSIVE.

Overall, this place isn't bad if you wanna come has some wines and snacks to eat and have some cheese plates, however, you're gonna spend a good bit. Nothing impressive for my first trip, I don't think this place would come across my mind again unless someone suggested.",YNjyv0gfOr2g8lbmUpTnKg,Copper Vine,New Orleans,4.5,-90.0744274301,29.9506467229,"Nightlife, Pubs, Event Planning & Services, Wine Bars, Bars, Gastropubs, Restaurants, Venues & Event Spaces","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-21:0', 'Friday': '11:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '10:30-22:0', 'Sunday': '10:30-21:0'}",1001 Poydras St,LA

Definitely set up to promote conversation with large tall top tables and a comfortable bar area complete  lots of lush plants to make it feel more intimate. Appropriate lighting and volume level to ACTUALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION AND NOT BE ON YOUR PHONE ALL NIGHT. Imagine that ;)

The food was reasonably priced and pretty tasty and actually came out quickly (even though they warned us of long ticket times in advance due to a computer glitch). We got the goat cheese and fig flat bread and the deviled eggs along with the tomato soup. The tomato soup was by far my favorite - acidic with just a hint of creaminess to even it out and a ton of garlic. With a slab of bread, it would have been heaven on a slightly chilly night. The deviled eggs had great mustardy flavor, but not the best value on the menu for $8 for 3 - there was supposed to be some crab as well but it was pretty minimal. The flatbread was tasty as well - nice thin yeasty crust with a bunch of goat cheese and a fig drizzle but I would have liked a little bit more accoutrement on top (Maybe some veg, arugula, fig pieces?) even though I enjoyed every last bite.

1708,4.0,"Good variety of salads, smoothies, and sandwiches. Not the super-upscale, organic, kale & quinoa type of choices; however, chopped fruits and salad ingredients looked fresh and they had many options, including soymilk, whey protein, yogurt, orange sherbet (but not the wildberry listed), & peanut butter. When I asked if I could substitute honey (which was listed as an ingredient in my smoothie), I was told the smoothie would not have had honey, anyway, so I couldn't substitute anything for it. Smoothie was good, nice texture, not too sweet.

Place is clean, with tables to sit. The older couple that was working when I went were efficient. Refrigerator for bottled drinks. Takes visa/MC/Disc/cash (no sign for AmEx). Nice to see a place like this in town!

(Just an ""update"" to respond to the owner, I originally found this place on Yelp. There were no reviews, but I was in the city, looking for a smoothie, and intrigued enough to take the risk.

1709,3.0,Pretty good preparation on the salads BUT the lady that runs it can be very moody at times almost to the point of being rude. Her husband is a sweet heart. One time the women was extremely rude and had the nerve to charge for an extra butter. So when you go inside you pick the size of your salad and then either you can get bread or a banana but this time I ordered the bread and I must say they're bread rolls are really good but the little tub of butter they give you is not even enough to butter the whole bread so when she charged me I was a little taken back surprised to say the least. Love their salads that's why I rated them them a 3. But their customer service I would definitely give them 2.

The owners are very old and move slowly so if you're running here on your lunch break like I was you won't have 40 minutes to wait. But, I did enjoy my food and smoothie !

All of the salads are huge and under $10. I got a make your own salad with spinach, grilled chicken, feta, beets, sundried tomatoes, and carrots for only TEN DOLLARS! Plus, it was a large and kept me full! If you do not want a side of bread they give you a banana which is great for those watching their carbs! 
Salad toppings are extensive, and include all your standard veggies, cheeses, and lean proteins. There is also a pasta salad you can top your salad with. To make things even better there are about 20 different dressings, including multiple fat free dressings. There are tables to sit for lunch and meter parking is outside (I never have trouble finding a spot). 
The couple working here is so nice. If you come here for lunch you will have a great meal and experience!
